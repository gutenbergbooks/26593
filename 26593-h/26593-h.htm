<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>AT THE STAGE DOOR</h3>
</div>

<p>Courtlandt sat perfectly straight; his
ample shoulders did not touch the back
of his chair; and his arms were folded tightly
across his chest. The characteristic of his attitude
was tenseness. The nostrils were well defined,
as in one who sets the upper jaw hard
upon the nether. His brown eyes&mdash;their
gaze directed toward the stage whence came
the voice of the prima donna&mdash;epitomized the
tension, expressed the whole as in a word.</p>
<p>Just now the voice was pathetically subdued,
yet reached every part of the auditorium,
kindling the ear with its singularly mellowing
sweetness. To Courtlandt it resembled, as no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
other sound, the note of a muffled Burmese
gong, struck in the dim incensed cavern of a
temple. A Burmese gong: briefly and magically
the stage, the audience, the amazing
gleam and scintillation of the Opera, faded.
He heard only the voice and saw only the
purple shadows in the temple at Rangoon, the
oriental sunset splashing the golden dome,
the wavering lights of the dripping candles,
the dead flowers, the kneeling devoteés, the
yellow-robed priests, the tatters of gold-leaf,
fresh and old, upon the rows of placid grinning
Buddhas. The vision was of short duration.
The sigh, which had been so long repressed,
escaped; his shoulders sank a little, and the
angle of his chin became less resolute; but only
for a moment. Tension gave place to an
ironical grimness. The brows relaxed, but
the lips became firmer. He listened, with this
new expression unchanging, to the high note
that soared above all others. The French
horns blared and the timpani crashed. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
curtain sank slowly. The audience rustled,
stood up, sought its wraps, and pressed toward
the exits and the grand staircase. It was all
over.</p>
<p>Courtlandt took his leave in leisure. Here
and there he saw familiar faces, but these,
after the finding glance, he studiously avoided.
He wanted to be alone. For while the music
was still echoing in his ears, in a subtone, his
brain was afire with keen activity; but unfortunately
for the going forward of things, this
mental state was divided into so many battalions,
led by so many generals, indirectly and
indecisively, nowhere. This plan had no beginning,
that one had no ending, and the other
neither beginning nor ending. Outside he
lighted a cigar, not because at that moment he
possessed a craving for nicotine, but because
like all inveterate smokers he believed that tobacco
conduced to clarity of thought. And
mayhap it did. At least, there presently followed
a mental calm that expelled all this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
confusion. The goal waxed and waned as he
gazed down the great avenue with its precise
rows of lamps. Far away he could discern the
outline of the brooding Louvre.</p>
<p>There was not the least hope in the world
for him to proceed toward his goal this night.
He realized this clearly, now that he was
face to face with actualities. It required
more than the chaotic impulses that had
brought him back from the jungles of the
Orient. He must reason out a plan that
should be like a straight line, the shortest
distance between two given points. How
then should he pass the night, since none of
his schemes could possibly be put into operation?
Return to his hotel and smoke himself
headachy? Try to become interested in a
novel? Go to bed, to turn and roll till dawn?
A wild desire seized him to make a night of
it,&mdash;Maxim&#8217;s, the cabarets; riot and wine.
Who cared? But the desire burnt itself out
between two puffs of his cigar. Ten years
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
ago, perhaps, this particular brand of amusement
might have urged him successfully. But
not now; he was done with tomfool nights.
Indeed, his dissipations had been whimsical
rather than banal; and retrospection never
aroused a furtive sense of shame.</p>
<p>He was young, but not so young as an idle
glance might conjecture in passing. To such
casual reckoning he appeared to be in the early
twenties; but scrutiny, more or less infallible,
noting a line here or an angle there, was disposed
to add ten years to the score. There
was in the nose and chin a certain decisiveness
which in true youth is rarely developed. This
characteristic arrives only with manhood,
manhood that has been tried and perhaps
buffeted and perchance a little disillusioned.
To state that one is young does not necessarily
imply youth; for youth is something that is
truly green and tender, not rounded out, aimless,
light-hearted and desultory, charming
and inconsequent. If man regrets his youth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
it is not for the passing of these pleasing,
though tangled attributes, but rather because
there exists between the two periods of progression
a series of irremediable mistakes.
And the subject of this brief commentary
could look back on many a grievous one
brought about by pride or carelessness rather
than by intent.</p>
<p>But what was one to do who had both
money and leisure linked to an irresistible desire
to leave behind one place or thing in pursuit
of another, indeterminately? At one
time he wanted to be an artist, but his evenly
balanced self-criticism had forced him to fling
his daubs into the ash-heap. They were good
daubs in a way, but were laid on without fire;
such work as any respectable schoolmarm
might have equaled if not surpassed. Then
he had gone in for engineering; but precise
and intricate mathematics required patience of
a quality not at his command.</p>
<p>The inherent ambition was to make money;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
but recognizing the absurdity of adding to his
income, which even in his extravagance he
could not spend, he gave himself over into the
hands of grasping railroad and steamship companies,
or their agencies, and became for a time
the slave of guide and dragoman and carrier.
And then the wanderlust, descended to him
from the blood of his roving Dutch ancestors,
which had lain dormant in the several generations
following, sprang into active life again.
He became known in every port of call. He
became known also in the wildernesses.
He had climbed almost inaccessible mountains,
in Europe, in Asia; he had fished and hunted
north, east, south and west; he had fitted out
polar expeditions; he had raided the pearl
markets; he had made astonishing gifts to
women who had pleased his fancy, but whom
he did not know or seek to know; he had kept
some of his intimate friends out of bankruptcy;
he had given the most extravagant
dinners at one season and, unknown, had supported
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
a bread-line at another; he had even
financed a musical comedy.</p>
<p>Whatever had for the moment appealed to
his fancy, that he had done. That the world&mdash;his
world&mdash;threw up its hands in wonder
and despair neither disturbed him nor swerved
him in the least. He was alone, absolute master
of his millions. Mamas with marriageable
daughters declared that he was impossible;
the marriageable daughters never had a
chance to decide one way or the other; and men
called him a fool. He had promoted elephant
fights which had stirred the Indian princes out
of their melancholy indifference, and tiger
hunts which had, by their duration and magnificence,
threatened to disrupt the efficiency of
the British military service,&mdash;whimsical excesses,
not understandable by his intimate acquaintances
who cynically arraigned him as the
fool and his money.</p>
<p>But, like the villain in the play, his income
still pursued him. Certain scandals inevitably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
followed, scandals he was the last to hear
about and the last to deny when he heard
them. Many persons, not being able to take
into the mind and analyze a character like
Courtlandt&#8217;s, sought the line of least resistance
for their understanding, and built some
precious exploits which included dusky island-princesses,
diaphanous dancers, and comic-opera
stars.</p>
<p>Simply, he was without direction; a thousand
goals surrounded him and none burned
with that brightness which draws a man toward
his destiny: until one day. Personally,
he possessed graces of form and feature, and
was keener mentally than most young men
who inherit great fortunes and distinguished
names.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Automobiles of all kinds panted hither and
thither. An occasional smart coupé went by
as if to prove that prancing horses were still
necessary to the dignity of the old aristocracy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Courtlandt made up his mind suddenly. He
laughed with bitterness. He knew now that
to loiter near the stage entrance had been his
real purpose all along, and persistent lying to
himself had not prevailed. In due time he
took his stand among the gilded youth who
were not privileged (like their more prosperous
elders) to wait outside the dressing-rooms
for their particular ballerina. By and by there
was a little respectful commotion. Courtlandt&#8217;s
hand went instinctively to his collar,
not to ascertain if it were properly adjusted,
but rather to relieve the sudden pressure. He
was enraged at his weakness. He wanted to
turn away, but he could not.</p>
<p>A woman issued forth, muffled in silks and
light furs. She was followed by another,
quite possibly her maid. One may observe
very well at times from the corner of the eye;
that is, objects at which one is not looking
come within the range of vision. The woman
paused, her foot upon the step of the modest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
limousine. She whispered something hurriedly
into her companion&#8217;s ear, something
evidently to the puzzlement of the latter, who
looked around irresolutely. She obeyed, however,
and retreated to the stage entrance. A
man, quite as tall as Courtlandt, his face
shaded carefully, intentionally perhaps, by one
of those soft Bavarian hats that are worn
successfully only by Germans, stepped out of
the gathering to proffer his assistance. Courtlandt
pushed him aside calmly, lifted his hat,
and smiling ironically, closed the door behind
the singer. The step which the other man
made toward Courtlandt was unequivocal in
its meaning. But even as Courtlandt squared
himself to meet the coming outburst, the stranger
paused, shrugged his shoulders, turned
and made off.</p>
<p>The lady in the limousine&mdash;very pale could
any have looked closely into her face&mdash;was
whirled away into the night. Courtlandt did
not stir from the curb. The limousine dwindled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
once it flashed under a light, and then
vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the American,&#8221; said one of the waiting
dandies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The icicle!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The volcano, rather, which fools believe
extinct.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably sent back her maid for her Bible.
Ah, these Americans; they are very amusing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was in magnificent voice to-night. I
wonder why she never sings <i>Carmen</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I not said that she is too cold?
What! would you see frost grow upon the
toreador&#8217;s mustache? And what a name,
what a name! Eleonora da Toscana!&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt was not in the most amiable condition
of mind, and a hint of the ribald would
have instantly transformed a passive anger into
a blind fury. Thus, a scene hung precariously;
but its potentialities became as nothing
on the appearance of another woman.</p>
<p>This woman was richly dressed, too richly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Apparently she had trusted her modiste not
wisely but too well: there was the strange and
unaccountable inherent love of fine feathers
and warm colors which is invariably the mute
utterance of peasant blood. She was followed
by a Russian, huge of body, Jovian of countenance.
An expensive car rolled up to the
curb. A liveried footman jumped down from
beside the chauffeur and opened the door.
The diva turned her head this way and that, a
thin smile of satisfaction stirring her lips.
For Flora Desimone loved the human eye
whenever it stared admiration into her own;
and she spent half her days setting traps and
lures, rather successfully. She and her formidable
escort got into the car which immediately
went away with a soft purring sound.
There was breeding in the engine, anyhow,
thought Courtlandt, who longed to put his
strong fingers around that luxurious throat
which had, but a second gone, passed him so
closely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We shall never have war with Russia,&#8221;
said some one; &#8220;her dukes love Paris too
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Light careless laughter followed this cynical
observation. Another time Courtlandt
might have smiled. He pushed his way into
the passage leading to the dressing-rooms,
and followed its windings until he met a human
barrier. To his inquiry the answer was
abrupt and perfectly clear in its meaning: La
Signorina da Toscana had given most emphatic
orders not to disclose her address to
any one. Monsieur might, if he pleased, make
further inquiries of the directors; the answer
there would be the same. Presently he found
himself gazing down the avenue once more.
There were a thousand places to go to, a thousand
pleasant things to do; yet he doddered,
full of ill-temper, dissatisfaction, and self-contempt.
He was weak, damnably weak;
and for years he had admired himself, detachedly,
as a man of pride. He started forward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
neither sensing his direction nor the
perfected flavor of his Habana.</p>
<p>Opera singers were truly a race apart.
They lived in the world but were not a part
of it, and when they died, left only a memory
which faded in one generation and became totally
forgotten in another. What jealousies,
what petty bickerings, what extravagances!
With fancy and desire unchecked, what ingenious
tricks they used to keep themselves in
the public mind,&mdash;tricks begot of fickleness
and fickleness begetting. And yet, it was a
curious phase: their influence was generally
found when history untangled for posterity
some Gordian knot. In old times they had
sung the <i>Marseillaise</i> and danced the <i>carmagnole</i>
and indirectly plied the guillotine. And
to-day they smashed prime ministers, petty
kings, and bankers, and created fashions for
the ruin of husbands and fathers of modest
means. Devil take them! And Courtlandt
flung his cigar into the street.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>He halted. The Madeleine was not exactly
the goal for a man who had, half an hour
before, contemplated a rout at Maxim&#8217;s. His
glance described a half-circle. There was
Durand&#8217;s; but Durand&#8217;s on opera nights entertained
many Americans, and he did not care
to meet any of his compatriots to-night. So
he turned down the Rue Royale, on the opposite
side, and went into the Taverne Royale,
where the patrons were not over particular in
regard to the laws of fashion, and where certain
ladies with light histories sought further
adventures to add to their heptamerons.
Now, Courtlandt thought neither of the one
nor of the other. He desired isolation, safety
from intrusion; and here, did he so signify, he
could find it. Women gazed up at him and
smiled, with interest as much as with invitation.
He was brown from long exposure to
the wind and the sun, that golden brown which
is the gift of the sun-glitter on rocking seas.
A traveler is generally indicated by this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
artistry of the sun, and once noted instantly
creates a speculative interest. Even his light
brown hair had faded at the temples, and
straw-colored was the slender mustache, the
ends of which had a cavalier twist. He ignored
the lips which smiled and the eyes which
invited, and nothing more was necessary.
One is not importuned at the Taverne Royale.
He sat down at a vacant table and ordered a
pint of champagne, drinking hastily rather
than thirstily.</p>
<p>Would Monsieur like anything to eat?</p>
<p>No, the wine was sufficient.</p>
<p>Courtlandt poured out a second glass slowly.
The wine bubbled up to the brim and overflowed.
He had been looking at the glass with
unseeing eyes. He set the bottle down impatiently.
Fool! To have gone to Burma, simply
to stand in the golden temple once more, in
vain, to recall that other time: the starving
kitten held tenderly in a woman&#8217;s arms, his
own scurry among the booths to find the milk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
so peremptorily ordered, and the smile of
thanks that had been his reward! He had
run away when he should have hung on. He
should have fought every inch of the
way....</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur is lonely?&#8221;</p>
<p>A pretty young woman sat down before him
in the vacant chair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THERE IS A WOMAN?</h3>
</div>

<p>Anger, curiosity, interest; these sensations
blanketed one another quickly,
leaving only interest, which was Courtlandt&#8217;s
normal state of mind when he saw a pretty
woman. It did not require very keen
scrutiny on his part to arrive swiftly at the
conclusion that this one was not quite in the
picture. Her cheeks were not red with that
redness which has a permanency of tone,
neither waxing nor waning, abashed in daylight.
Nor had her lips found their scarlet
moisture from out the depths of certain little
porcelain boxes. Decidedly she was out of
place here, yet she evinced no embarrassment;
she was cool, at ease. Courtlandt&#8217;s interest
strengthened.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think I am lonely, Mademoiselle?&#8221;
he asked, without smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, when one talks to one&#8217;s self, strikes
the table, wastes good wine, the inference is
but natural. So, Monsieur is lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips and eyes, as grave and smileless as
his own, puzzled him. An adventure? He
looked at some of the other women. Those
he could understand, but this one, no. At all
times he was willing to smile, yet to draw her
out he realized that he must preserve his gravity
unbroken. The situation was not usual.
His gaze came back to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the comparison favorable to me?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is. What is loneliness?&#8221; he demanded
cynically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I could tell you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It
is the longing to be with the one we love; it
is the hate of the wicked things we have done;
it is remorse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That echoes of the Ambigu-Comique.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
He leaned upon his arms. &#8220;What are you
doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You do not talk like the other girls
who come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur comes here frequently, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time in five years. I
came here to-night because I wanted to be
alone, because I did not wish to meet any one
I knew. I have scowled at every girl in the
room, and they have wisely left me alone. I
haven&#8217;t scowled at you because I do not know
what to make of you. That&#8217;s frankness.
Now, you answer my question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you spare me a glass of wine? I
am thirsty.&#8221;</p>
<p>He struck his hands together, a bit of orientalism
he had brought back with him. The
observant waiter instantly came forward with
a glass.</p>
<p>The young woman sipped the wine, gazing
into the glass as she did so. &#8220;Perhaps a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
whim brought me here. But I repeat, Monsieur
is lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So lonely that I am almost tempted to put
you into a taxicab and run away with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She set down the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The spark of eagerness in her eyes was instantly
curtained. &#8220;There is a woman?&#8221;
tentatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there not always a woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she has disappointed Monsieur?&#8221;
There was no marked sympathy in the tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Eve, has that not been woman&#8217;s part
in the human comedy?&#8221; He was almost certain
that her lips became firmer. &#8220;Smile, if
you wish. It is not prohibitory here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was evident that the smile had been struggling
for existence, for it endured to the fulness
of half a minute. She had fine teeth.
He scrutinized her more closely, and she bore
it well. The forehead did not make for
beauty; it was too broad and high, intellectual.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
Her eyes were splendid. There was nothing
at all ordinary about her. His sense of puzzlement
renewed itself and deepened. What
did she want of him? There were other men,
other vacant chairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur is certain about the taxicab?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it is to emulate Saint Anthony!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several saints of that name.
To which do you refer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Positively not to him of Padua.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt laughed. &#8220;No, I can not fancy
myself being particularly concerned about
bambini. No, my model is Noah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Noah?&#8221; dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. At the time of the flood there was
only one woman in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid that your knowledge of that
event is somewhat obscured. Still, I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted the wine-glass again, and then he
noticed her hand. It was large, white and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
strong; it was not the hand of a woman who
dallied, who idled in primrose paths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, what is it you wish? You interest
me, at a moment, too, when I do not want
to be interested. Are you really in trouble?
Is there anything I can do ... barring
the taxicab?&#8221;</p>
<p>She twirled the glass, uneasily. &#8220;I am not
in actual need of assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you spoke peculiarly regarding loneliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I like the melodrama. You
spoke of the Ambigu-Comique.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are on the stage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Opera?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Again perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed once more, and drew his chair
closer to the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur in other moods must have a
pleasant laughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t laughed from the heart in a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
long time,&#8221; he said, returning to his former
gravity, this time unassumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have accomplished this amazing
thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You followed me here. But from
where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Followed you?&#8221; The effort to give a
mocking accent to her voice was a failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The idea just occurred to me.
There were other vacant chairs, and there was
nothing inviting in my facial expression.
Come, let me have the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a friend who knows Flora Desimone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; As if this information was a direct
visitation of kindness from the gods.
&#8220;Then you know where the Calabrian lives?
Give me her address.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a minute wrinkle above the unknown&#8217;s
nose; the shadow of a frown. &#8220;She
is very beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah! Did she send you after me? Give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
me her address. I have come all the way
from Burma to see Flora Desimone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To see her?&#8221; She unguardedly clothed
the question with contempt, but she instantly
forced a smile to neutralize the effect. Concerned
with her own defined conclusions, she
lost the fine ironic bitterness that was in the
man&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, indeed, to see her! Beautiful as
Venus, as alluring as Phryne, I want nothing
so much as to see her, to look into her eyes, to
hear her voice!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it jealousy? I hear the tragic note.&#8221;
The certainty of her ground became as morass
again. In his turn he was puzzling her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tragedy? I am an American. We do
not kill opera singers. We turn them over to
the critics. I wish to see the beautiful Flora,
to ask her a few questions. If she has sent
you after me, her address, my dear young
lady, her address.&#8221; His eyes burned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid.&#8221; And she was so. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
wasn&#8217;t the tone of a man madly in love. It
was wild anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you a hundred francs.&#8221; He
watched her closely and shrewdly.</p>
<p>Came the little wrinkle again, but this time
urged in perplexity. &#8220;A hundred francs, for
something I was sent to tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now refuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very generous. She has a heart of
flint, Monsieur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I know it. Perhaps now I have one
of steel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many sparks do not make a fire. Do you
know that your French is very good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent my boyhood in Paris; some of it.
Her address, if you please.&#8221; He produced a
crisp note for a hundred francs. &#8220;Do you
want it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer at once. Presently she
opened her purse, found a stubby pencil and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
slip of paper, and wrote. &#8220;There it is, Monsieur.&#8221;
She held out her hand for the bank-note
which, with a sense of bafflement, he gave
her. She folded the note and stowed it away
with the pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Courtlandt. &#8220;Odd
paper, though.&#8221; He turned it over. &#8220;Ah, I
understand. You copy music.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Monsieur.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time the nervous flicker of her eyes did
not escape him. &#8220;You are studying for the
opera, perhaps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eagerness of the admission convinced
him that she was not. Who she was or
whence she had come no longer excited his interest.
He had the Calabrian&#8217;s address and
he was impatient to be off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221; He rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur is not gallant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in my youth,&#8221; he replied, putting on
his hat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>The bald rudeness of his departure did not
disturb her. She laughed softly and relievedly.
Indeed, there was in the laughter an
essence of mischief. However, if he carried
away a mystery, he left one behind.</p>
<p>As he was hunting for a taxicab, the waiter
ran out and told him that he had forgotten to
settle for the wine. The lady had refused to
do so. Courtlandt chuckled and gave him a
ten-franc piece. In other days, in other circumstances,
he would have liked to know more
about the unknown who scribbled notes on
composition paper. She was not an idler in
the Rue Royale, and it did not require that
indefinable intuition which comes of worldly-wiseness
to discover this fact. She might be
a friend of the Desimone woman, but she had
stepped out of another sphere to become so.
He recognized the quality that could adjust
itself to any environment and come out scatheless.
This was undeniably an American accomplishment;
and yet she was distinctly a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
Frenchwoman. He dismissed the problem
from his mind and bade the driver go as fast
as the police would permit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the young woman waited five or
ten minutes, and, making sure that Courtlandt
had been driven off, left the restaurant.
Round the corner she engaged a carriage. So
that was Edward Courtlandt? She liked his
face; there was not a weak line in it, unless
stubbornness could be called such. But to
stay away for two years! To hide himself in
jungles, to be heard of only by his harebrained
exploits! &#8220;Follow him; see where he goes,&#8221;
had been the command. For a moment she
had rebelled, but her curiosity was not to be
denied. Besides, of what use was friendship
if not to be tried? She knew nothing of the
riddle, she had never asked a question openly.
She had accidentally seen a photograph one
day, in a trunk tray, with this man&#8217;s name
scrawled across it, and upon this flimsy base
she had builded a dozen romances, each of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
which she had ruthlessly torn down to make
room for another; but still the riddle lay unsolved.
She had thrown the name into the
conversation many a time, as one might throw
a bomb into a crowd which had no chance to
escape. Fizzles! The man had been calmly
discussed and calmly dismissed. At odd times
an article in the newspapers gave her an opportunity;
still the frank discussion, still the
calm dismissal. She had learned that the man
was rich, irresponsible, vacillating, a picturesque
sort of fool. But two years? What
had kept him away that long? A weak man,
in love, would not have made so tame a surrender.
Perhaps he had not surrendered;
perhaps neither of them had.</p>
<p>And yet, he sought the Calabrian. Here
was another blind alley out of which she had
to retrace her steps. Bother! That Puck of
Shakespeare was right: What fools these
mortals be! She was very glad that she possessed
a true sense of humor, spiced with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
harmless audacity. What a dreary world it
must be to those who did not know how and
when to laugh! They talked of the daring of
the American woman: who but a Frenchwoman
would have dared what she had this
night? The taxicab! She laughed. And
this man was wax in the hands of any pretty
woman who came along! So rumor had it.
But she knew that rumor was only the attenuated
ghost of Ananias, doomed forever to
remain on earth for the propagation of inaccurate
whispers. Wax! Why, she would
have trusted herself in any situation with a
man with those eyes and that angle of jaw.
It was all very mystifying. &#8220;Follow him;
see where he goes.&#8221; The frank discussion,
then, and the calm dismissal were but a
woman&#8217;s dissimulation. And he had gone to
Flora Desimone&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The carriage stopped before a handsome
apartment-house in the Avenue de Wagram.
The unknown got out, gave the driver his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
fare, and rang the concierge&#8217;s bell. The
sleepy guardian opened the door, touched his
gold-braided cap in recognition, and led the
way to the small electric lift. The young
woman entered and familiarly pushed the
button. The apartment in which she lived
was on the second floor; and there was luxury
everywhere, but luxury subdued and charmed
by taste. There were fine old Persian rugs on
the floors, exquisite oils and water-colors on
the walls; and rare Japanese silk tapestries
hung between the doors. In one corner of the
living-room was a bronze jar filled with artificial
cherry blossoms; in another corner
near the door, hung a flat bell-shaped piece of
brass&mdash;a Burmese gong. There were many
photographs ranged along the mantel-top;
celebrities, musical, artistic and literary, each
accompanied by a liberal expanse of autographic
ink.</p>
<p>She threw aside her hat and wraps with
that manner of inconsequence which distinguishes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
the artistic temperament from the
thrifty one, and passed on into the cozy dining-room.
The maid had arranged some
sandwiches and a bottle of light wine. She
ate and drank, while intermittent smiles
played across her merry face. Having satisfied
her hunger, she opened her purse and
extracted the bank-note. She smoothed it out
and laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if only he had taken me for a ride
in the taxicab!&#8221; She bubbled again with
merriment.</p>
<p>Suddenly she sprang up, as if inspired, and
dashed into another room, a study. She
came back with pen and ink, and with a
celerity that came of long practise, drew
five straight lines across the faint violet face
of the bank-note. Within these lines she
made little dots at the top and bottom of
stubby perpendicular strokes, and strange
interlineal hieroglyphics, and sweeping curves,
all of which would have puzzled an Egyptologist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
if he were unused to the ways of
musicians. Carefully she dried the composition,
and then put the note away. Some day
she would confound him by returning it.</p>
<p>A little later her fingers were moving softly
over the piano keys; melodies in minor, sad
and haunting and elusive, melodies that had
never been put on paper and would always
be her own: in them she might leap from
comedy to tragedy, from laughter to tears, and
only she would know. The midnight adventure
was forgotten, and the hero of it,
too. With her eyes closed and her lithe body
swaying gently, she let the old weary pain in
her heart take hold again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE BEAUTIFUL TIGRESS</h3>
</div>

<p>Flora Desimone had been born in
a Calabrian peasant&#8217;s hut, and she had
rolled in the dust outside, yelling vigorously at
all times. Specialists declare that the reason
for all great singers coming from lowly origin
is found in this early development of the
muscles of the throat. Parents of means employ
nurses or sedatives to suppress or at
least to smother these infantile protests against
being thrust inconsiderately into the turmoil of
human beings. Flora yelled or slept, as the
case might be; her parents were equally indifferent.
They were too busily concerned with
the getting of bread and wine. Moreover,
Flora was one among many. The gods are always
playing with the Calabrian peninsula,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
heaving it up here or throwing it down there:
<i>il terremoto</i>, the earthquake, the terror. Here
nature tinkers vicariously with souls; and she
seldom has time to complete her work. Constant
communion with death makes for callosity
of feeling; and the Calabrians and the
Sicilians are the cruellest among the civilized
peoples. Flora was ruthless.</p>
<p>She lived amazingly well in the premier of
an apartment-hotel in the Champs-Elysées.
In England and America she had amassed a
fortune. Given the warm beauty of the Southern
Italian, the passion, the temperament, the
love of mischief, the natural cruelty, the inordinate
craving for attention and flattery,
she enlivened the nations with her affairs.
And she never put a single beat of her heart
into any of them. That is why her voice is
still splendid and her beauty unchanging.
She did not dissipate; calculation always
barred her inclination; rather, she loitered
about the Forbidden Tree and played that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
had plucked the Apple. She had an example
to follow; Eve had none.</p>
<p>Men scattered fortunes at her feet as
foolish Greeks scattered floral offerings at the
feet of their marble gods&mdash;without provoking
the sense of reciprocity or generosity or
mercy. She had worked; ah, no one would
ever know how hard. She had been crushed,
beaten, cursed, starved. That she had risen
to the heights in spite of these bruising verbs
in no manner enlarged her pity, but dulled and
vitiated the little there was of it. Her mental
attitude toward humanity was childish: as,
when the parent strikes, the child blindly
strikes back. She was determined to play, to
enjoy life, to give back blow for blow, nor
caring where she struck. She was going to
press the juice from every grape. A thousand
odd years gone, she would have led the cry
in Rome&mdash;&#8220;Bread and the circus!&#8221; or &#8220;To
the lions!&#8221; She would have disturbed
Nero&#8217;s complacency, and he would have played
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
an obbligato instead of a solo at the burning.
And she was malice incarnate. They came
from all climes&mdash;her lovers&mdash;with roubles
and lire and francs and shillings and dollars;
and those who finally escaped her enchantment
did so involuntarily, for lack of further funds.
They called her villas Circe&#8217;s isles. She
hated but two things in the world; the man
she could have loved and the woman she could
not surpass.</p>
<p>Arrayed in a kimono which would have
evoked the envy of the empress of Japan, supposing
such a gorgeous raiment&mdash;peacocks
and pine-trees, brilliant greens and olives and
blues and purples&mdash;fell under the gaze of
that lady&#8217;s slanting eyes, she sat opposite the
Slavonic Jove and smoked her cigarette between
sips of coffee. Frequently she smiled.
The short powerful hand of the man stroked
his beard and he beamed out of his cunning
eyes, eyes a trifle too porcine to suggest a keen
intellect above them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am like a gorilla,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but you are
like a sleek tigress. I am stronger, more
powerful than you; but I am always in fear
of your claws. Especially when you smile
like that. What mischief are you plotting
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew in a cloud of smoke, held it in
her puffed cheeks as she glided round the
table and leaned over his shoulders. She let
the smoke drift over his head and down his
beard. In that moment he was truly Jovian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like me if I were a tame
cat?&#8221; she purred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen you in that rôle. Perhaps
I might. You told me that you would
give up everything but the Paris season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have changed my mind.&#8221; She ran one
hand through his hair and the other she entangled
in his beard. &#8220;You&#8217;d change your
mind, too, if you were a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to change my mind; you are
always doing it for me. But I do not want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
to go to America next winter.&#8221; He drew
her down so that he might look into her face.
It was something to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; She released herself and returned
to her chair. &#8220;When the season is
over I want to go to Capri.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Capri! Too hot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, a dozen exiles are there, waiting
to blow me up.&#8221; He spoke Italian well.
&#8220;You do not wish to see me spattered over
the beautiful isle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tch! tch! That is merely your usual excuse.
You never had anything to do with the
police.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; He eyed the end of his cigarette
gravely. &#8220;One does not have to be affiliated
with the police. There is class prejudice.
We Russians are very fond of Egypt in the
winter. Capri seems to be the half-way place.
They wait for us, going and coming. Poor
fools!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall go alone, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; In his dull way he had
learned that to pull the diva, one must agree
with her. In agreeing with her one adroitly
dissuaded her. &#8220;You go to Capri, and I&#8217;ll
go to the pavilion on the Neva.&#8221;</p>
<p>She snuffed the cigarette in the coffee-cup
and frowned. &#8220;Some day you will make me
horribly angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beautiful tigress! If a man knew what
you wanted, you would not want it. I can&#8217;t
hop about with the agility of those dancers
at the Théâtre du Palais Royale. The best I
can do is to imitate the bear. What is
wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They keep giving her the premier parts.
She has no more fire in her than a dead
grate. The English-speaking singers, they
are having everything their own way. And
none of them can act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Flora, this Eleonora is an
actress, first of all. That she can sing is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
matter of good fortune, no more. Be reasonable.
The consensus of critical opinion is
generally infallible; and all over the continent
they agree that she can act. Come, come;
what do you care? She will never approach
your Carmen....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You praise her to me?&#8221; tempest in her
glowing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not praise her. I am quoting facts.
If you throw that cup, my tigress....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; dangerously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will spoil the set. Listen. Some one
is at the speaking-tube.&#8221;</p>
<p>The singer crossed the room impatiently.
Ordinarily she would have continued the dispute,
whether the bell rang or not. But she
was getting the worst of the argument and
the bell was a timely diversion. The duke
followed her leisurely to the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Flora in French.</p>
<p>The voice below answered with a query in
English. &#8220;Is this the Signorina Desimone?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is the duchess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The duchess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned and stared at the duke, who
shrugged. &#8220;No, no,&#8221; she said; &#8220;the duchess,
not the devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me; I was astonished. But on
the stage you are still Flora Desimone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And now that my identity is established,
who are you and what do you want
at this time of night?&#8221;</p>
<p>The duke touched her arm to convey that
this was not the moment in which to betray
her temper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Edward Courtlandt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221; mimicked the diva.</p>
<p>She and the duke heard a chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon again, Madame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is it you wish?&#8221; amiably.</p>
<p>The duke looked at her perplexedly. It
seemed to him that she was always leaving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
him in the middle of things. Preparing himself
for rough roads, he would suddenly find
the going smooth. He was never swift
enough mentally to follow these flying
transitions from enmity to amity. In the
present instance, how was he to know that his
tigress had found in the man below something
to play with?</p>
<p>&#8220;You once did me an ill turn,&#8221; came up
the tube. &#8220;I desire that you make some
reparation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sainted Mother! but it has taken you a
long time to find out that I have injured you,&#8221;
she mocked.</p>
<p>There was no reply to this; so she was determined
to stir the fire a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I advise you to be careful what you
say; the duke is a very jealous man.&#8221;</p>
<p>That gentleman fingered his beard thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care a hang if he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The duke coughed loudly close to the tube.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The least you can do, Madame, is to give
me her address.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her address!&#8221; repeated the duke relievedly.
He had had certain grave doubts, but
these now took wing. Old flames were not
in the habit of asking, nay, demanding, other
women&#8217;s addresses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am speaking to Madame, your Highness,&#8221;
came sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not speak off the stage,&#8221; said the
singer, pushing the duke aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to make that young man&#8217;s
acquaintance,&#8221; whispered the duke.</p>
<p>She warned him to be silent.</p>
<p>Came the voice again: &#8220;Will you give me
her address, please? Your messenger gave
me your address, inferring that you wished to
see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; There was no impeaching her astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Madame.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Courtlandt, you are the last
man in all the wide world I wish to see. And
I do not quite like the way you are making
your request. His highness does not either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send him down!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember. You are very strong and
much given to fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The duke opened and shut his hands, pleasurably.
Here was something he could understand.
He was a fighting man himself.
Where was this going to end, and what was
it all about?</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you not think, Madame, that you owe
me something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. What I owe I pay. Think, Mr.
Courtlandt; think well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand,&#8221; impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ebbene</i>, I owe you nothing. Once I
heard you say&mdash;&#8216;I do not like to see you with
the Calabrian; she is&mdash;Well, you know.&#8217; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
stood behind you at another time when you
said that I was a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame, I do not forget that, that is pure
invention. You are mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You were. I am no fool.&#8221; A light
laugh drifted down the tube.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame, I begin to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You believe what you wish to believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never even noticed you,&#8221; carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; whispered the duke, who
noted the sudden dilation of her nostrils.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is easy to forget,&#8221; cried the diva,
furiously. &#8220;It is easy for you to forget, but
not for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame, I do not forget that you entered
my room that night ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your address!&#8221; bawled the duke. &#8220;That
statement demands an explanation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should explain at once, your Highness,&#8221;
said the man down below calmly, &#8220;only I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
prefer to leave that part in Madame&#8217;s hands.
I should not care to rob her of anything so interesting
and dramatic. Madame the duchess
can explain, if she wishes. I am stopping at
the Grand, if you find her explanations are not
up to your requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall give you her address,&#8221; interrupted
the diva, hastily. The duke&#8217;s bristling beard
for one thing and the ice in the other man&#8217;s
tones for another, disquieted her. The play
had gone far enough, much as she would have
liked to continue it. This was going deeper
than she cared to go. She gave the address
and added: &#8220;To-night she sings at the Austrian
ambassador&#8217;s. I give you this information
gladly because I know that it will be of
no use to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall dispense with the formality
of thanking you. I add that I wish you twofold
the misery you have carelessly and
gratuitously cost me. Good night!&#8221; Click!
went the little covering of the tube.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the duke, whose knowledge of
the English tongue was not so indifferent that
he did not gather the substance, if not all the
shadings, of this peculiar conversation; &#8220;now,
what the devil is all this about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Refused to singe his wings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has insulted me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am curious to learn about that night you
went to his room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her bear had a ring in his nose, but she
could not always lead him by it. So, without
more ado, she spun the tale, laughing at intervals.
The story evidently impressed the
duke, for his face remained sober all through
the recital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he say that you were a fool?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I challenge him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my Russian bear, he fences like a
Chicot; he is a dead shot; and is afraid of
nothing ... but a woman. No, no; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
have something better. It will be like one of
those old comedies. I hate her!&#8221; with a
burst of fury. &#8220;She always does everything
just so much better than I do. As for him, he
was nothing. It was she; I hurt her, wrung
her heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; mildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is not that enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am slow; it takes a long time for anything
to get into my head; but when it arrives,
it takes a longer time to get it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, go on.&#8221; Her calm was ominous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Love or vanity. This American singer got
what you could not get. You have had your
way too long. Perhaps you did not love him.
I do not believe you can really love any one
but Flora. Doubtless he possessed millions;
but on the other hand, I am a grand duke; I
offered marriage, openly and legally, in spite
of all the opposition brought to bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flora was undeniably clever. She did the
one thing that could successfully cope with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
this perilous condition of the ducal mind. She
laughed, and flung her arms around his neck
and kissed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have named you well. You are a
tigress. But this comedy of which you speak:
it might pass in Russia, but not in Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not be in the least concerned. My
part was suggestion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You suggested it to some one else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My objections ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will have my way in this affair. Besides,
it is too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her gesture was explicit. He sighed. He
knew quite well that she was capable of leaving
the apartment that night, in her kimono.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to Capri,&#8221; resignedly. Dynamite
bombs were not the worst things in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The duke picked up a fresh cigarette.
&#8220;How the devil must have laughed when the
Lord made Eve!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE JOKE OF MONSIEUR</h3>
</div>

<p>With the same inward bitterness that
attends the mental processes of a performing
tiger on being sent back to its cage,
Courtlandt returned to his taxicab. He
wanted to roar and lash and devour something.
Instead, he could only twist the ends of his
mustache savagely. So she was a grand
duchess, or at least the morganatic wife of
a grand duke! It did not seem possible that
any woman could be so full of malice. He
simply could not understand. It was essentially
the Italian spirit; doubtless, till she heard
his voice, she had forgotten all about the
episode that had foundered his ship of happiness.</p>
<p>Her statement as to the primal cause was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
purely inventive. There was not a grain of
truth in it. He could not possibly have been
so rude. He had been too indifferent. Too
indifferent! The repetition of the phrase
made him sit straighter. Pshaw! It could
not be that. He possessed a little vanity; if
he had not, his history would not have been
worth a scrawl. But he denied the possession
vehemently, as men are wont to do.
Strange, a man will admit smashing those
ten articles of advisement known as the
decalogue and yet deny the inherent quality
which surrenders the admission&mdash;vanity.
However you may look at it, man&#8217;s vanity is
a complex thing. The vanity of a woman has
a definite and commendable purpose: the conquest
of man, his purse, and half of his time.
Too indifferent! Was it possible that he
had roused her enmity simply because he had
made it evident that her charms did not interest
him? Beyond lifting his hat to her,
perhaps exchanging a comment on the weather,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
his courtesies had not been extended. Courtlandt
was peculiar in some respects. A
woman attracted him, or she did not. In the
one case he was affable, winning, pleasant, full
of those agreeable little surprises that in
turn attract a woman. In the other case, he
passed on, for his impressions were instant
and did not require the usual skirmishing.</p>
<p>A grand duchess! The straw-colored mustache
now described two aggressive points.
What an impossible old world it was! The
ambition of the English nobility was on a
far lower scale than that of their continental
cousins. On the little isle they were satisfied
to marry soubrettes and chorus girls. Here,
the lady must be no less a personage than a
grand-opera singer or a <i>première danseuse</i>.
The continental noble at least showed some
discernment; he did not choose haphazard; he
desired the finished product and was not to
be satisfied with the material in the raw.</p>
<p>Oh, stubborn Dutchman that he had been!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Blind fool! To have run away instead of
fighting to the last ditch for his happiness!
The Desimone woman was right: it had taken
him a long time to come to the conclusion that
she had done him an ill turn. And during all
these weary months he had drawn a melancholy
picture of himself as a wounded lion,
creeping into the jungle to hide its hurts, when,
truth be known, he had taken the ways of the
jackass for a model. He saw plainly enough
now. More than this, where there had been
mere obstacles to overcome there were now
steep mountains, perhaps inaccessible for all
he knew. His jaw set, and the pressure of
his lips broke the sweep of his mustache, converting
it into bristling tufts, warlike and resolute.</p>
<p>As he was leaving, a square of light attracted
his attention. He looked up to see the
outline of the bearded Russ in the window.
Poor devil! He was going to have a merry
time of it. Well, that was his affair. Besides,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Russians, half the year chilled by their
bitter snows, were susceptible to volcanoes;
they courted them as a counterbalance. Perhaps
he had spoken roughly, but his temper
had not been under control. One thing he
recalled with grim satisfaction. He had sent
a barbed arrow up the tube to disturb the
felicity of the dove-cote. The duke would be
rather curious to know what was meant in
referring to the night she had come to his,
Courtlandt&#8217;s, room. He laughed. It would
be a fitting climax indeed if the duke called
him out.</p>
<p>But what of the pretty woman in the Taverne
Royale? What about her? At whose
bidding had she followed him? One or
the other of them had not told the truth, and
he was inclined to believe that the prevarication
had its source in the pomegranate lips of
the Calabrian. To give the old barb one more
twist, to learn if its venomous point still held
and hurt; nothing would have afforded the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
diva more delight. Courtlandt glared at the
window as the shade rolled down.</p>
<p>When the taxicab joined the long line of
carriages and automobiles opposite the Austrian
ambassador&#8217;s, Courtlandt awoke to the
dismal and disquieting fact that he had formulated
no plan of action. He had done no more
than to give the driver his directions; and now
that he had arrived, he had the choice of two
alternatives. He could wait to see her come
out or return at once to his hotel, which, as
subsequent events affirmed, would have been
the more sensible course. He would have
been confronted with small difficulty in gaining
admission to the house. He knew enough
of these general receptions; the announcing of
his name would have conveyed nothing to the
host, who knew perhaps a third of his guests,
and many of these but slightly. But such an
adventure was distasteful to Courtlandt. He
could not overstep certain recognized boundaries
of convention, and to enter a man&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
house unasked was colossal impudence. Beyond
this, he realized that he could have accomplished
nothing; the advantage would have
been hers. Nor could he meet her as she
came out, for again the odds would have been
largely in her favor. No, the encounter must
be when they two were alone. She must be
surprised. She must have no time to use her
ready wit. He had thought to wait until
some reasonable plan offered itself for trial;
yet, here he was, with nothing definite or recognizable
but the fact that the craving to see
her was not to be withstood. The blood began
to thunder in his ears. An idea presented
itself. It appealed to him at that moment as
quite clever and feasible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; he called to the driver.</p>
<p>He dived among the carriages and cars, and
presently he found what he sought,&mdash;her
limousine. He had taken the number into his
mind too keenly to be mistaken. He saw the
end of his difficulties; and he went about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
affair with his usual directness. It was only
at rare times that he ran his head into a cul-de-sac.
If her chauffeur was regularly employed
in her service, he would have to return
to the hotel; but if he came from the garage,
there was hope. Every man is said to have
his price, and a French chauffeur might prove
no notable exception to the rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you driver for Madame da Toscana?&#8221;
Courtlandt asked of the man lounging in the
forward seat.</p>
<p>The chauffeur looked hard at his questioner,
and on finding that he satisfied the requirements
of a gentleman, grumbled an affirmative.
The limousine was well known in Paris,
and he was growing weary of these endless inquiries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in her employ directly, or do you
come from the garage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am from the garage, but I drive
mademoiselle&#8217;s car most of the time, especially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
at night. It is not madame but mademoiselle,
Monsieur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mistake.&#8221; A slight pause. It was
rather a difficult moment for Courtlandt. The
chauffeur waited wonderingly. &#8220;Would you
like to make five hundred francs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How, Monsieur?&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt should have been warned by the
tone, which contained no unusual interest or
eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Permit me to remain in mademoiselle&#8217;s
car till she comes. I wish to ride with her to
her apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chauffeur laughed. He stretched his
legs. &#8220;Thanks, Monsieur. It is very dull
waiting. Monsieur knows a good joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>And to Courtlandt&#8217;s dismay he realized that
his proposal had truly been accepted as a jest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not joking. I am in earnest. Five
hundred francs. On the word of a gentleman
I mean mademoiselle no harm. I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
known to her. All she has to do is to appeal
to you, and you can stop the car and summon
the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chauffeur drew in his legs and leaned
toward his tempter. &#8220;Monsieur, if you are
not jesting, then you are a madman. Who
are you? What do I know about you? I
never saw you before, and for two seasons
I have driven mademoiselle in Paris. She
wears beautiful jewels to-night. How do I
know that you are not a gentlemanly thief?
Ride home with mademoiselle! You are crazy.
Make yourself scarce, Monsieur; in one minute
I shall call the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blockhead!&#8221;</p>
<p>English of this order the Frenchman perfectly
understood. &#8220;<i>Là, là!</i>&#8221; he cried, rising
to execute his threat.</p>
<p>Courtlandt was furious, but his fury was
directed at himself as much as at the trustworthy
young man getting down from the
limousine. His eagerness had led him to mistake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
stupidity for cleverness. He had gone
about the affair with all the clumsiness of a
boy who was making his first appearance at
the stage entrance. It was mightily disconcerting,
too, to have found an honest man
when he was in desperate need of a dishonest
one. He had faced with fine courage all sorts
of dangerous wild animals; but at this moment
he hadn&#8217;t the courage to face a policeman and
endeavor to explain, in a foreign tongue, a
situation at once so delicate and so singularly
open to misconstruction. So, for the second
time in his life he took to his heels. Of the
first time, more anon. He scrambled back to
his own car, slammed the door, and told the
driver to drop him at the Grand. His undignified
retreat caused his face to burn; but
discretion would not be denied. However, he
did not return to the hotel.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle da Toscana&#8217;s chauffeur
scratched his chin in perplexity. In frightening
off his tempter he recognized that now he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
would never be able to find out who he was.
He should have played with him until mademoiselle
came out. She would have known
instantly. That would have been the time for
the police. To hide in the car! What the
devil! Only a madman would have offered
such a proposition. The man had been either
an American or an Englishman, for all his accuracy
in the tongue. Bah! Perhaps he had
heard her sing that night, and had come away
from the Opera, moonstruck. It was not an
isolated case. The fools were always pestering
him, but no one had ever offered so uncommon
a bribe: five hundred francs. Mademoiselle
might not believe that part of the
tale. Mademoiselle was clever. There was a
standing agreement between them that she
would always give him half of whatever was
offered him in the way of bribes. It paid.
It was easier to sell his loyalty to her for two
hundred and fifty francs than to betray her
for five hundred. She had yet to find him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
untruthful, and to-night he would be as frank
as he had always been.</p>
<p>But who was this fellow in the Bavarian
hat, who patrolled the sidewalk? He had
been watching him when the madman approached.
For an hour or more he had
walked up and down, never going twenty feet
beyond the limousine. He couldn&#8217;t see the
face. The long dark coat had a military cut
about the hips and shoulders. From time to
time he saw him glance up at the lighted
windows. Eh, well; there were other women
in the world besides mademoiselle, several
others.</p>
<p>He had to wait only half an hour for her
appearance. He opened the door and saw
to it that she was comfortably seated; then he
paused by the window, touching his cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, François?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentleman offered me five hundred
francs, Mademoiselle, if I would permit him
to hide in the car.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred francs? To hide in the car?
Why didn&#8217;t you call the police?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I started to, Mademoiselle, but he ran
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! What was he like?&#8221; The prima
donna dropped the bunch of roses on the seat
beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he looked well enough. He had the
air of a gentleman. He was tall, with light
hair and mustache. But as I had never seen
him before, and as Mademoiselle wore some
fine jewels, I bade him be off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you know him again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The next time any one bothers you, call
the police. You have done well, and I shall
remember it. Home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man in the Bavarian hat hurried back
to the third car from the limousine, and followed
at a reasonably safe distance.</p>
<p>The singer leaned back against the cushions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
She was very tired. The opera that night had
taxed her strength, and but for her promise
she would not have sung to the ambassador&#8217;s
guests for double the fee. There was an
electric bulb in the car. She rarely turned it
on, but she did to-night. She gazed into the
little mirror; and utter weariness looked back
from out the most beautiful, blue, Irish eyes
in the world. She rubbed her fingers carefully
up and down the faint perpendicular
wrinkle above her nose. It was always there
on nights like this. How she longed for the
season to end! She would fly away to the
lakes, the beautiful, heavenly tinted lakes,
the bare restful mountains, and the clover lawns
spreading under brave old trees; she would
walk along the vineyard paths, and loiter under
the fig-trees, far, far away from the world,
its clamor, its fickleness, its rasping jealousies.
Some day she would have enough; and then,
good-by to all the clatter, the evil-smelling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
stages, the impossible people with whom she
was associated. She would sing only to those
she loved.</p>
<p>The glamour of the life had long ago
passed; she sang on because she had acquired
costly habits, because she was fond of beautiful
things, and above all, because she loved to
sing. She had as many moods as a bird, as
many sides as nature. A flash of sunshine
called to her voice; the beads of water,
trembling upon the blades of grass after a
summer shower, brought a song to her lips.
Hers was a God-given voice, and training had
added to it nothing but confidence. True, she
could act; she had been told by many a great
impressario that histrionically she had no peer
in grand opera. But the knowledge gave her
no thrill of delight. To her it was the sum
of a tremendous physical struggle.</p>
<p>She shut off the light and closed her eyes.
She reclined against the cushion once more,
striving not to think. Once, her hands shut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
tightly. Never, never, never! She pressed
down the burning thoughts by recalling the
bright scenes at the ambassador&#8217;s, the real
generous applause that had followed her two
songs. Ah, how that man Paderewski played!
They two had cost the ambassador eight
thousand francs. Fame and fortune! Fortune
she could understand; but fame! What
was it? Upon a time she believed she had
known what fame was; but that had been
when she was striving for it. A glowing article
in a newspaper, a portrait in a magazine,
rows upon rows of curious eyes and a patter
of hands upon hands; that was all; and for
this she had given the best of her life, and she
was only twenty-five.</p>
<p>The limousine stopped at last. The man in
the Bavarian hat saw her alight. His car
turned and disappeared. It had taken him a
week to discover where she lived. His lodgings
were on the other side of the Seine. After
reaching them he gave crisp orders to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
driver, who set his machine off at top speed.
The man in the Bavarian hat entered his room
and lighted the gas. The room was bare and
cheaply furnished. He took off his coat but
retained his hat, pulling it down still farther
over his eyes. His face was always in shadow.
A round chin, two full red lips, scantily covered
by a blond mustache were all that could be
seen. He began to walk the floor impatiently,
stopping and listening whenever he heard a
sound. He waited less than an hour for the
return of the car. It brought two men.
They were well-dressed, smoothly-shaven, with
keen eyes and intelligent faces. Their host,
who had never seen either of his guests before,
carelessly waved his hand toward the
table where there were two chairs. He himself
took his stand by the window and looked
out as he talked. In another hour the room
was dark and the street deserted.</p>
<p>In the meantime the prima donna gave a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
sigh of relief. She was home. It was nearly
two o&#8217;clock. She would sleep till noon, and
Saturday and Sunday would be hers. She
went up the stairs instead of taking the lift,
and though the hall was dark, she knew
her way. She unlocked the door of the apartment
and entered, swinging the door behind
her. As the act was mechanical, her thoughts
being otherwise engaged, she did not notice
that the lock failed to click. The ferrule of
a cane had prevented that.</p>
<p>She flung her wraps on the divan and put
the roses in an empty bowl. The door opened
softly, without noise. Next, she stopped before
the mirror over the mantel, touched her
hair lightly, detached the tiara of emeralds
 ... and became as inanimate as marble.
She saw another face. She never knew how
long the interval of silence was. She turned
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is I!&#8221; said the man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Instantly she turned again to the mantel and
picked up a magazine-revolver. She leveled
it at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave this room, or I will shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt advanced toward her slowly.
&#8220;Do so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I should much prefer a
bullet to that look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in earnest.&#8221; She was very white,
but her hand was steady.</p>
<p>He continued to advance. There followed
a crash. The smell of burning powder filled
the room. The Burmese gong clanged shrilly
and whirled wildly. Courtlandt felt his hair
stir in terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must hate me indeed,&#8221; he said quietly,
as the sense of terror died away. He folded
his arms. &#8220;Try again; there ought to be half
a dozen bullets left. No? Then, good-by!&#8221;
He left the apartment without another word
or look, and as the door closed behind him
there was a kind of finality in the clicking of
the latch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>The revolver clattered to the floor, and the
woman who had fired it leaned heavily against
the mantel, covering her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora, Nora!&#8221; cried a startled voice from
a bedroom adjoining. &#8220;What has happened?
<i>Mon Dieu</i>, what is it?&#8221; A pretty, sleepy-eyed
young woman, in a night-dress, rushed
into the room. She flung her arms about the
singer. &#8220;Nora, my dear, my dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He forced his way in. I thought to
frighten him. It went off accidentally. Oh,
Celeste, Celeste, I might have killed him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other drew her head down on her
shoulder, and listened. She could hear voices
in the lower hall, a shout of warning, a patter
of steps; then the hall door slammed. After
that, silence, save for the faint mellowing
vibrations of the Burmese gong.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>CAPTIVE OR RUNAWAY</h3>
</div>

<p>At the age of twenty-six Donald Abbott
had become a prosperous and distinguished
painter in water-colors. His work
was individual, and at the same time it was
delicate and charming. One saw his Italian
landscapes as through a filmy gauze: the
almond blossoms of Sicily, the rose-laden
walls of Florence, the vineyards of Chianti,
the poppy-glowing Campagna out of Rome.
His Italian lakes had brought him fame. He
knew very little of the grind and hunger that
attended the careers of his whilom associates.
His father had left him some valuable patents&mdash;wash-tubs,
carpet-cleaners, and other labor-saving
devices&mdash;and the royalties from these
were quite sufficient to keep him pleasantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
housed. When he referred to his father (of
whom he had been very fond) it was as an inventor.
Of what, he rarely told. In America
it was all right; but over here, where these
inventions were unknown, a wash-tub had a
peculiar significance: that a man should be
found in his money through its services left
persons in doubt as to his genealogical tree,
which, as a matter of fact, was a very good
one. As a boy his schoolmates had dubbed
him &#8220;The Sweep&#8221; and &#8220;Suds,&#8221; and it was
only human that he should wish to forget.</p>
<p>His earnings (not inconsiderable, for tourists
found much to admire in both the pictures
and the artist) he spent in gratifying his mild
extravagances. So there were no lines in his
handsome, boyish, beardless face; and his
eyes were unusually clear and happy. Perhaps
once or twice, since his majority, he had
returned to America to prove that he was not
an expatriate, though certainly he was one,
the only tie existing between him and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
native land being the bankers who regularly
honored his drafts. And who shall condemn
him for preferring Italy to the desolate center
of New York state, where good servants and
good weather are as rare as are flawless emeralds?</p>
<p>Half after three, on Wednesday afternoon,
Abbott stared moodily at the weather-tarnished
group by Dalou in the Luxembourg
gardens&mdash;the <i>Triumph of Silenus</i>. His gaze
was deceptive, for the rollicking old bibulous
scoundrel had not stirred his critical sense
nor impressed the delicate films of thought.
He was looking through the bronze, into the
far-away things. He sat on his own folding
stool, which he had brought along from his
winter studio hard by in the old Boul&#8217; Miche&#8217;.
He had arrived early that morning, all the way
from Como, to find a thunderbolt driven in
at his feet. Across his knees fluttered an
open newspaper, the Paris edition of the New
York <i>Herald</i>. All that kept it from blowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
away was the tense if sprawling fingers of his
right hand; his left hung limply at his side.</p>
<p>It was not possible. Such things did not
happen these unromantic days to musical
celebrities. She had written that on Monday
night she would sing in <i>La Bohème</i> and on
Wednesday, <i>Faust</i>. She had since vanished,
vanished as completely as though she had taken
wings and flown away. It was unreal. She
had left the apartment in the Avenue de
Wagram on Saturday afternoon, and nothing
had been seen or heard of her since. At the
last moment they had had to find a substitute
for her part in the Puccini opera. The maid
testified that her mistress had gone on an
errand of mercy. She had not mentioned
where, but she had said that she would return
in time to dress for dinner, which proved conclusively
that something out of the ordinary
had befallen her.</p>
<p>The automobile that had carried her away
had not been her own, and the chauffeur was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
unknown. None of the directors at the Opera
had been notified of any change in the singer&#8217;s
plans. She had disappeared, and they
were deeply concerned. Singers were generally
erratic, full of sudden indispositions, unaccountable
whims; but the Signorina da Toscana
was one in a thousand. She never broke
an engagement. If she was ill she said so at
once; she never left them in doubt until the
last moment. Indecision was not one of her
characteristics. She was as reliable as the
sun. If the directors did not hear definitely
from her by noon to-day, they would have to
find another Marguerite.</p>
<p>The police began to move, and they stirred
up some curious bits of information. A man
had tried to bribe the singer&#8217;s chauffeur, while
she was singing at the Austrian ambassador&#8217;s.
The chauffeur was able to describe the stranger
with some accuracy. Then came the bewildering
episode in the apartment: the pistol-shot,
the flight of the man, the astonished concierge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
to whom the beautiful American would offer
no explanations. The man (who tallied with
the description given by the chauffeur) had
obtained entrance under false representations.
He claimed to be an emissary with important
instructions from the Opera. There was
nothing unusual in this; messengers came at
all hours, and seldom the same one twice; so
the concierge&#8217;s suspicions had not been
aroused. Another item. A tall handsome
Italian had called at eleven o&#8217;clock Saturday
morning, but the signorina had sent down
word that she could not see him. The maid
recalled that her mistress had intended to dine
that night with the Italian gentleman. His
name she did not know, having been with the
signorina but two weeks.</p>
<p>Celeste Fournier, the celebrated young pianist
and composer, who shared the apartment
with the missing prima donna, stated that she
hadn&#8217;t the slightest idea where her friend was.
She was certain that misfortune had overtaken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
her in some inexplicable manner. To
implicate the Italian was out of the question.
He was well-known to them both. He had
arrived again at seven, Saturday, and was very
much surprised that the signorina had not yet
returned. He had waited till nine, when he
left, greatly disappointed. He was the Barone
di Monte-Verdi in Calabria, formerly military
attaché at the Italian embassy in Berlin. Sunday
noon Mademoiselle Fournier had notified
the authorities. She did not know, but she
felt sure that the blond stranger knew more
than any one else. And here was the end of
things. The police found themselves at a
standstill. They searched the hotels but without
success; the blond stranger could not be
found.</p>
<p>Abbott&#8217;s eyes were not happy and pleasant
just now. They were dull and blank with the
reaction of the stunning blow. He, too, was
certain of the Barone. Much as he secretly
hated the Italian, he knew him to be a fearless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
and an honorable man. But who could this
blond stranger be who appeared so sinisterly
in the two scenes? From where had he come?
Why had Nora refused to explain about the
pistol-shot? Any woman had a perfect
right to shoot a man who forced his way into
her apartment. Was he one of those mad
fools who had fallen in love with her, and had
become desperate? Or was it some one she
knew and against whom she did not wish
to bring any charges? Abducted! And she
might be, at this very moment, suffering all
sorts of indignities. It was horrible to be so
helpless.</p>
<p>The sparkle of the sunlight upon the ferrule
of a cane, extending over his shoulder, broke
in on his agonizing thoughts. He turned,
an angry word on the tip of his tongue. He
expected to see some tourist who wanted to
be informed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ted Courtlandt!&#8221; He jumped up, overturning
the stool. &#8220;And where the dickens
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
did you come from? I thought you were in
the Orient?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just got back, Abby.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two shook hands and eyed each other
with the appraising scrutiny of friends of long
standing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t change any,&#8221; said Abbott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor do you. I&#8217;ve been standing behind
you fully two minutes. What were you
glooming about? Old Silenus offend you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you read the <i>Herald</i> this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never read it nowadays. They are always
giving me a roast of some kind. Whatever
I do they are bound to misconstrue it.&#8221;
Courtlandt stooped and righted the stool, but
sat down on the grass, his feet in the path.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble? Have they been after
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Abbott rescued the offending paper and
shaking it under his friend&#8217;s nose, said:
&#8220;Read that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt&#8217;s eyes widened considerably as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
they absorbed the significance of the heading&mdash;&#8220;Eleonora
da Toscana missing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say bah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like one of their advertising
dodges. I know something about singers,&#8221;
Courtlandt added. &#8220;I engineered a musical
comedy once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not know anything about her,&#8221;
cried Abbott hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough.&#8221; Courtlandt finished
the article, folded the paper and returned it,
and began digging in the path with his cane.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what I want to know is, who the devil
is this mysterious blond stranger?&#8221; Abbott
flourished the paper again. &#8220;I tell you, it&#8217;s
no advertising dodge. She&#8217;s been abducted.
The hound!&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt ceased boring into the earth.
&#8220;The story says that she refused to explain
this blond chap&#8217;s presence in her room. What
do you make of that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you think the fellow was her
press-agent?&#8221; was the retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, no! But it proves that she knew
him, that she did not want the police to find
him. At least, not at that moment. Who&#8217;s
the Italian?&#8221; suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can vouch for him. He is a gentleman,
honorable as the day is long, even if he is
hot-headed at times. Count him out of it.
It&#8217;s this unknown, I tell you. Revenge for
some imagined slight. It&#8217;s as plain as the nose
on your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you known her?&#8221; asked
Courtlandt presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;About two years. She&#8217;s the gem of the
whole lot. Gentle, kindly, untouched by flattery.... Why,
you must have seen and
heard her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have.&#8221; Courtlandt stared into the hole
he had dug. &#8220;Voice like an angel&#8217;s, with a
face like Bellini&#8217;s donna; and Irish all over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
But for all that, you will find that her disappearance
will turn out to be a diva&#8217;s whim.
Hang it, Suds, I&#8217;ve had some experience with
singers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a blockhead!&#8221; exploded the
younger man.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I am.&#8221; Courtlandt laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, she wrote me that she would sing
Monday and to-night, and wanted me to hear
her. I couldn&#8217;t get here in time for <i>La
Bohème</i>, but I was building on <i>Faust</i>. And
when she says a thing, she means it. As you
said, she&#8217;s Irish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m Dutch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the stubbornest Dutchman I ever met.
Why don&#8217;t you go home and settle down and
marry?&mdash;and keep that phiz of yours out of
the newspapers? Sometimes I think you&#8217;re as
crazy as a bug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An opinion shared by many. Maybe I
am. I dash in where lunatics fear to tread.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Come on over to the Soufflet and have a drink
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not drinking to-day,&#8221; tersely.
&#8220;There&#8217;s too much ahead for me to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to start out to find her? Oh, Sir
Galahad!&#8221; ironically. &#8220;Abby, you used to
be a sport. I&#8217;ll wager a hundred against a
bottle of pop that to-morrow or next day she&#8217;ll
turn up serenely, with the statement that she
was indisposed, sorry not to have notified the
directors, and all that. They do it repeatedly
every season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But an errand of mercy, the strange automobile
which can not be found? The engagement
to dine with the Barone? Celeste
Fournier&#8217;s statement? You can&#8217;t get around
these things. I tell you, Nora isn&#8217;t that kind.
She&#8217;s too big in heart and mind to stoop to any
such devices,&#8221; vehemently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora! That looks pretty serious, Abby.
You haven&#8217;t gone and made a fool of yourself,
have you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you call making a fool of myself?&#8221;
truculently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t a suitor, are you? An accepted
suitor?&#8221; unruffled, rather kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I would to heaven that I were!&#8221;
Abbott jammed the newspaper into his pocket
and slung the stool over his arm. &#8220;Come on
over to the studio until I get some money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are really going to start a search?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really am. I&#8217;d start one just as quickly
for you, if I heard that you had vanished under
mysterious circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you honestly would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an old misanthrope. I hope some
woman puts the hook into you some day.
Where did you pick up the grouch? Some of
your dusky princesses give you the go-by?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, too, Abby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, rot! Of course I never believed any
of that twaddle. Only, I&#8217;ve got a sore head
to-day. If you knew Nora as well as I do,
you&#8217;d understand.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>Courtlandt walked on a little ahead of the
artist, who looked up and down the athletic
form, admiringly. Sometimes he loved the
man, sometimes he hated him. He marched
through tragedy and comedy and thrilling adventure
with no more concern that he evinced
in striding through these gardens. Nearly
every one had heard of his exploits; but who
among them knew anything of the real man,
so adroitly hidden under unruffled externals?
That there was a man he did not know, hiding
deep down within those powerful shoulders,
he had not the least doubt. He himself possessed
the quick mobile temperament of the
artist, and he could penetrate but not understand
the poise assumed with such careless ease
by his friend. Dutch blood had something to
do with it, and there was breeding, but there
was something more than these: he was a
reversion, perhaps, to the type of man which
had made the rovers of the Lowlands feared
on land and sea, now hemmed in by convention,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
hampered by the barriers of progress, and
striving futilely to find an outlet for his peculiar
energies. One bit of knowledge gratified
him; he stood nearer to Courtlandt than
any other man. He had known the adventurer
as a boy, and long separations had in nowise
impaired the foundations of this friendship.</p>
<p>Courtlandt continued toward the exit, his
head forward, his gaze bent on the path.
He had the air of a man deep in thought,
philosophic thought, which leaves the brows
unmarred by those corrugations known as
frowns. Yet his thoughts were far from
philosophic. Indeed, his soul was in mad turmoil.
He could have thrown his arms toward
the blue sky and cursed aloud the fates that
had set this new tangle at his feet. He longed
for the jungles and some mad beast to vent
his wrath upon. But he gave no sign. He
had returned with a purpose as hard and grim
as iron; and no obstacle, less powerful than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
death, should divert or control him. Abduction?
Let the public believe what it might;
he held the key to the mystery. She was
afraid, and had taken flight. So be it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Ted,&#8221; called out the artist, &#8220;what
did you mean by saying that you were a Dutchman?&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt paused so that Abbott might
catch up to him. &#8220;I said that I was a Dutchman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And it has just occurred to me that
you meant something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. You were talking of Da Toscana?
Let&#8217;s call her Harrigan. It will save
time, and no one will know to whom we refer.
You said she was Irish, and that when she
said a thing she meant it. My boy, the Irish
are notorious for claiming that. They often
say it before they see clearly. Now, we
Dutchmen,&mdash;it takes a long time for us to
make up our minds, but when we do, something
has got to bend or break.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that you are going
to settle down and get married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to settle down and get married,
if that will ease your mind any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, I was hoping!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three meals a day in the same house, with
the same woman, never appealed to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want, one for each meal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the dusky princess peeking out
again. The truth is, Abby, if I could hide
myself for three or four years, long enough
for people to forget me, I might reconsider.
But it should be under another name. They
envy us millionaires. Why, we are the lonesomest
duffers going. We distrust every one;
we fly when a woman approaches; we become
monomaniacs; one thing obsesses us, everybody
is after our money. We want friends,
we want wives, but we want them to be attracted
to us and not to our money-bags. Oh,
pshaw! What plans have you made in regard
to the search?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>Gloom settled upon the artist&#8217;s face. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got to find out what&#8217;s happened to her, Ted.
This isn&#8217;t any play. Why, she loves the part
of Marguerite as she loves nothing else.
She&#8217;s been kidnaped, and only God knows
for what reason. It has knocked me silly. I
just came up from Como, where she spends
the summers now. I was going to take her
and Fournier out to dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Fournier?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Fournier, the composer.
She goes with Nora on the yearly concert
tours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; thoughtfully. &#8220;What part of the
lake; the Villa d&#8217;Este, Cadenabbia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bellaggio. Oh, it was ripping last summer.
She&#8217;s always singing when she&#8217;s happy.
When she sings out on the terrace, suddenly,
without giving any one warning, her voice is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
wonderful. No audience ever heard anything
like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard her Friday night. I dropped in
at the Opera without knowing what they were
singing. I admit all you say in regard to her
voice and looks; but I stick to the whim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t fake that chap with the
blond mustache,&#8221; retorted Abbott grimly.
&#8220;Lord, I wish I had run into you any day
but to-day. I&#8217;m all in. I can telephone to
the Opera from the studio, and then we shall
know for a certainty whether or not she will
return for the performance to-night. If not,
then I&#8217;m going in for a little detective work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abby, it will turn out to be the sheep of
Little Bo-Peep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have your own way about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they arrived at the studio Abbott telephoned
promptly. Nothing had been heard.
They were substituting another singer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call up the <i>Herald</i>,&#8221; suggested Courtlandt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>Abbott did so. And he had to answer innumerable
questions, questions which worked
him into a fine rage: who was he, where did
he live, what did he know, how long had he
been in Paris, and could he prove that he had
arrived that morning? Abbott wanted to
fling the receiver into the mouth of the transmitter,
but his patience was presently rewarded.
The singer had not yet been found,
but the chauffeur of the mysterious car had
turned up ... in a hospital, and perhaps
by night they would know everything. The
chauffeur had had a bad accident; the car
itself was a total wreck, in a ditch, not far
from Versailles.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; cried Abbott, slamming the receiver
on the hook. &#8220;What do you say to
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The chauffeur may have left her somewhere,
got drunk afterward, and plunged into
the ditch. Things have happened like that.
Abby, don&#8217;t make a camel&#8217;s-hair shirt out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
your paint-brushes. What a pother about a
singer! If it had been a great inventor, a
poet, an artist, there would have been nothing
more than a two-line paragraph. But an
opera-singer, one who entertains us during our
idle evenings&mdash;ha! that&#8217;s a different matter.
Set instantly that great municipal machinery
called the police in action; sell extra editions
on the streets. What ado!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil makes <i>you</i> so bitter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was I bitter? I thought I was philosophizing.&#8221;
Courtlandt consulted his watch.
Half after four. &#8220;Come over to the Maurice
and dine with me to-morrow night, that is, if
you do not find your prima donna. I&#8217;ve an
engagement at five-thirty, and must be off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was about to ask you to dine with me
to-night,&#8221; disappointedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t; awfully sorry, Abby. It was only
luck that I met you in the Luxembourg. Be
over about seven. I was very glad to see you
again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>Abbott kicked a broken easel into a corner.
&#8220;All right. If anything turns up I&#8217;ll let you
know. You&#8217;re at the Grand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. By-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what&#8217;s the matter with him,&#8221;
mused the artist, alone. &#8220;Some woman has
chucked him. Silly little fool, probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt went down-stairs and out into
the boulevard. Frankly, he was beginning to
feel concerned. He still held to his original
opinion that the diva had disappeared of her
own free will; but if the machinery of the
police had been started, he realized that his
own safety would eventually become involved.
By this time, he reasoned, there would not be
a hotel in Paris free of surveillance. Naturally,
blond strangers would be in demand.
The complications that would follow his own
arrest were not to be ignored. He agreed
with his conscience that he had not acted with
dignity in forcing his way into her apartment.
But that night he had been at odds with convention;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
his spirit had been that of the marauding
old Dutchman of the seventeenth century.
He perfectly well knew that she was in the
right as far as the pistol-shot was concerned.
Further, he knew that he could quash any
charge she might make in that direction by the
simplest of declarations; and to avoid this
simplest of declarations she would prefer silence
above all things. They knew each other
tolerably well.</p>
<p>It was extremely fortunate that he had not
been to the hotel since Saturday. He went directly
to the war-office. The great and powerful
man there was the only hope left. They
had met some years before in Algiers, where
Courtlandt had rendered him a very real
service.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not expect you to the minute,&#8221; the
great man said pleasantly. &#8220;You will not
mind waiting for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least. Only, I&#8217;m in a deuce of
a mess,&#8221; frankly and directly. &#8220;Innocently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
enough, I&#8217;ve stuck my head into the police
net.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible that now I can pay my debt
to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such as it is. Have you read the article
in the newspapers regarding the disappearance
of Signorina da Toscana, the singer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the unknown blond. To-morrow
morning I want you to go with me to the
prefecture and state that I was with you all of
Saturday and Sunday; that on Monday you
and your wife dined with me, that yesterday
we went to the aviation meet, and later to the
Odéon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In brief, an alibi?&#8221; smiling now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. I shall need one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a perfectly good alibi. But I have
your word that you are in nowise concerned?
Pardon the question, but between us it is
really necessary if I am to be of service to
you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;On my word as a gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is sufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, I do not believe that she has been
abducted at all. Will you let me use your pad
and pen for a minute?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other pushed over the required articles.
Courtlandt scrawled a few words and passed
back the pad.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me to read?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; moodily.</p>
<p>The Frenchman read. Courtlandt watched
him anxiously. There was not even a flicker
of surprise in the official eye. Calmly he
ripped off the sheet and tore it into bits, distributing
the pieces into the various waste-baskets
yawning about his long flat desk.
Next, still avoiding the younger man&#8217;s eye, he
arranged his papers neatly and locked them
up in a huge safe which only the artillery of
the German army could have forced. He then
called for his hat and stick. He beckoned to
Courtlandt to follow. Not a word was said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
until the car was humming on the road to
Vincennes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Courtlandt, finally. It was
not possible for him to hold back the question
any longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear friend, I am taking you out to
the villa for the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have nothing....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have everything, even foresight.
If you were arrested to-night it would cause
you some inconvenience. I am fifty-six, some
twenty years your senior. Under this hat of
mine I carry a thousand secrets, and every one
of these thousand must go to the grave with
me, yours along with them. I have met you
a dozen times since those Algerian days, and
never have you failed to afford me some
amusement or excitement. You are the most
interesting and entertaining young man I
know. Try one of these cigars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Precisely at the time Courtlandt stepped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
into the automobile outside the war-office, a
scene, peculiar in character, but inconspicuous
in that it did not attract attention, was enacted
in the Gare de l&#8217;Est. Two sober-visaged men
stood respectfully aside to permit a tall young
man in a Bavarian hat to enter a compartment
of the second-class. What could be seen of
the young man&#8217;s face was full of smothered
wrath and disappointment. How he hated
himself, for his weakness, for his cowardice!
He was not all bad. Knowing that he was
being watched and followed, he could not go
to Versailles and compromise her, uselessly.
And devil take the sleek demon of a woman
who had prompted him to commit so base an
act!</p>
<p>&#8220;You will at least,&#8221; he said, &#8220;deliver that
message which I have intrusted to your care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall reach Versailles to-night, your
Highness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man reread the telegram which
one of the two men had given him a moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
since. It was a command which even he, wilful
and disobedient as he was, dared not
ignore. He ripped it into shreds and flung
them out of the window. He did not apologize
to the man into whose face the pieces
flew. That gentleman reddened perceptibly,
but he held his tongue. The blare of a horn
announced the time of departure. The train
moved. The two men on the platform saluted,
but the young man ignored the salutation.
Not until the rear car disappeared in
the hazy distance did the watchers stir. Then
they left the station and got into the tonneau
of a touring-car, which shot away and did not
stop until it drew up before that imposing embassy
upon which the French will always look
with more or less suspicion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE BIRD BEHIND BARS</h3>
</div>

<p>The most beautiful blue Irish eyes in the
world gazed out at the dawn which
turned night-blue into day-blue and paled the
stars. Rosal lay the undulating horizon, presently
to burst into living flame, transmuting
the dull steel bars of the window into fairy
gold, that trick of alchemy so futilely sought
by man. There was a window at the north
and another at the south, likewise barred; but
the Irish eyes never sought these two. It was
from the east window only that they could see
the long white road that led to Paris.</p>
<p>The nightingale was truly caged. But the
wild heart of the eagle beat in this nightingale&#8217;s
breast, and the eyes burned as fiercely
toward the east as the east burned toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
west. Sunday and Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday and Thursday, to-day; and that
the five dawns were singular in beauty and
that she had never in her life before witnessed
the creation of five days, one after another,
made no impression upon her sense of the
beautiful, so delicate and receptive in ordinary
times. She was conscious that within her the
cup of wrath was overflowing. Of other
things, such as eating and sleeping and moving
about in her cage (more like an eagle indeed
than a nightingale), recurrence had
blunted her perception.</p>
<p>Her clothes were soiled and crumpled,
sundrily torn; her hair was in disorder, and
tendrils hung about her temples and forehead&mdash;thick
black hair, full of purple tones in the
sunlight&mdash;for she had not surrendered peacefully
to this incarceration. Dignity, that
phase of philosophy which accepts quietly the
inevitable, she had thrown to the winds. She
had fought desperately, primordially, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
she had learned that her errand of mercy was
nothing more than a cruel hoax.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but he shall pay, he shall pay!&#8221; she
murmured, striving to loosen the bars with
her small, white, helpless hands. The cry
seemed to be an arietta, for through all these
four maddening days she had voiced it,&mdash;now
low and deadly with hate, now full-toned in
burning anger, now broken by sobs of despair.
&#8220;Will you never come, so that I may tell you
how base and vile you are?&#8221; she further addressed
the east.</p>
<p>She had waited for his appearance on Sunday.
Late in the day one of the jailers had
informed her that it was impossible for the
gentleman to come before Monday. So she
marshaled her army of phrases, of accusations,
of denunciations, ready to smother him
with them the moment he came. But he came
not Monday, nor Tuesday, nor Wednesday.
The suspense was to her mind diabolical.
She began to understand: he intended to keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
her there till he was sure that her spirit was
broken, then he would come. Break her
spirit? She laughed wildly. He could break
her spirit no more easily than she could break
these bars. To bring her to Versailles upon
an errand of mercy! Well, he was capable of
anything.</p>
<p>The room was large and fairly comfortable,
but contained nothing breakable, having been
tenanted at one time by a strenuous lunatic,
who had considerately died after his immediate
family and relations had worn themselves
into their several graves, taking care of
him. But Eleonora Harrigan knew nothing
of the history of the room while she occupied
it. So, no ghost disturbed her restless slumberless
nights, consumed in watching and
listening.</p>
<p>She was not particularly distressed because
she knew that it would not be possible for
her to sing again until the following winter in
New York. She had sobbed too much, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
her face buried in the pillow. Had these sobs
been born of weakness, all might have been
well; but rage had mothered them, and thus
her voice was in a very bad way. This morning
she was noticeably hoarse, and there was
a break in the arietta. No, she did not fret
over this side of the calamity. The sting of it
all lay in the fact that she had been outraged
in the matter of personal liberty, with no act
of reprisal to ease her immediate longing to be
avenged.</p>
<p>Nora, as she stood in the full morning sunlight,
was like to gladden the eyes of all mankind.
She was beautiful, and all adjectives
applicable would but serve to confuse rather
than to embellish her physical excellence. She
was as beautiful as a garden rose is, needing
no defense, no ramparts of cloying phrases.
The day of poets is gone, otherwise she would
have been sung in cantos. She was tall,
shapely, deep-bosomed, fine-skinned. Critics,
in praising her charms, delved into mythology
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
and folk-lore for comparisons, until there
wasn&#8217;t a goddess left on Olympus or on
Northland&#8217;s icy capes; and when these images
became a little shop-worn, referred to certain
masterpieces of the old fellows who had left
nothing more to be said in oils. Nora enjoyed
it all.</p>
<p>She had not been happy in the selection of
her stage name; but she had chosen Eleonora
da Toscana because she believed there was
good luck in it. Once, long before the world
knew of her, she had returned home from Italy
unexpectedly. &#8220;Molly, here&#8217;s Nora, from
Tuscany!&#8221; her delighted father had cried: who
at that time had a nebulous idea that Tuscany
was somewhere in Ireland because it had a Celtic
ring to it. Being filled with love of Italy,
its tongue, its history, its physical beauty, she
naïvely translated &#8220;Nora from Tuscany&#8221; into
Italian, and declared that when she went upon
the stage she would be known by that name.
There had been some smiling over the pseudonym;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
but Nora was Irish enough to cling to it.
By and by the great music-loving public ceased
to concern itself about her name; it was her
fresh beauty and her wonderful voice they
craved to see and hear. Kings and queens, emperors
and empresses, princes and princesses,&mdash;what
is called royalty and nobility in the newspapers
freely gave her homage. Quite a rise
in the world for a little girl who had once lived
in a shabby apartment in New York and run
barefooted on the wet asphalts, summer nights!</p>
<p>But Nora was not recalling the happy scenes
of her childhood; indeed, no; she was still
threatening Paris. Once there, she would not
lack for reprisals. To have played on her
pity! To have made a lure of her tender concern
for the unfortunate! Never would she
forgive such baseness. And only a little while
ago she had been as happy as the nightingale
to which they compared her. Never had she
wronged any one; she had been kindness and
thoughtfulness to all with whom she had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
in contact. But from now on!... Her
fingers tightened round the bars. She might
have posed as Dido when she learned that the
noble Æneas was dead. War, war; woe to
the moths who fluttered about her head hereafter!</p>
<p>Ah, but had she been happy? Her hands
slid down the bars. Her expression changed.
The mouth drooped, the eagle-light in her eyes
dimmed. From out the bright morning,
somewhere, had come weariness, and with this
came weakness, and finally, tears.</p>
<p>She heard the key turn in the lock. They
had never come so early before. She was
astonished to see that her jailer did not close
the door as usual. He put down the breakfast
tray on the table. There was tea and toast
and fruit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, there has been a terrible
mistake,&#8221; said the man humbly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! So you have found that out?&#8221; she
cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You are not the person for whom
this room was intended.&#8221; Which was half
a truth and perfectly true, paradoxical as it
may seem. &#8220;Eat your breakfast in peace.
You are free, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Free? You will not hinder me if I walk
through that door?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mademoiselle. On the contrary, I
shall be very glad, and so will my brother,
who guards you at night. I repeat, there has
been a frightful mistake. Monsieur Champeaux ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur Champeaux!&#8221; Nora was bewildered.
She had never heard this name
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;He calls himself that,&#8221; was the diplomatic
answer.</p>
<p>All Nora&#8217;s suspicions took firm ground
again. &#8220;Will you describe this Monsieur
Champeaux to me?&#8221; asked the actress coming
into life.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is short, dark, and old, Mademoiselle.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Rather is he not tall, blond, and young?&#8221;
ironically.</p>
<p>The jailer concealed what annoyance he felt.
In his way he was just as capable an actor
as she was. The accuracy of her description
startled him; for the affair had been carried
out so adroitly that he had been positive that
until her real captor appeared she would be
totally in the dark regarding his identity.
And here she had hit it off in less than a dozen
words. Oh, well; it did not matter now.
She might try to make it unpleasant for his
employer, but he doubted the ultimate success
of her attempts. However, the matter was at
an end as far as he was concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you thought what this means? It
is abduction. It is a crime you have committed,
punishable by long imprisonment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been Mademoiselle&#8217;s jailer, not her
abductor. And when one is poor and in need
of money!&#8221; He shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you a thousand francs for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
name and address of the man who instigated
this outrage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, he thought: then she wasn&#8217;t so sure?
&#8220;I told you the name, Mademoiselle. As for
his address, I dare not give it, not for ten
thousand francs. Besides, I have said that
there has been a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For whom have I been mistaken?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who but Monsieur Champeaux&#8217;s wife,
Mademoiselle, who is not in her right mind?&#8221;
with inimitable sadness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Nora. &#8220;You say that I
am free. That is all I want, freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In twenty minutes the electric tram leaves
for Paris. You will recall, Mademoiselle,&#8221;
humbly, &#8220;that we have taken nothing belonging
to you. You have your purse and hat and
cloak. The struggle was most unfortunate.
But, think, Mademoiselle, think; we thought
you to be insane!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Permit me to doubt that! And you are
not afraid to let me go?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least, Mademoiselle. A mistake
has been made, and in telling you to go at
once, we do our best to rectify this mistake.
It is only five minutes to the tram. A carriage
is at the door. Will Mademoiselle be pleased
to remember that we have treated her with the
utmost courtesy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall remember everything,&#8221; ominously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Mademoiselle. You will be in
Paris before nine.&#8221; With this he bowed and
backed out of the room as though Nora had
suddenly made a distinct ascension in the scale
of importance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she called.</p>
<p>His face appeared in the doorway again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who I am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since this morning, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Free! Her veins tingled with strange exultation.
He had lost his courage and had
become afraid of the consequences. Free!
Monsieur Champeaux indeed! Cowardice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
was a new development in his character. He
had been afraid to come. She drank the tea,
but did not touch the toast or fruit. There
would be time enough for breakfast when she
arrived in Paris. Her hands trembled violently
as she pinned on her hat, and she was
not greatly concerned as to the angle. She
snatched up her purse and cloak, and sped out
into the street. A phaeton awaited her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tram,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And go quickly.&#8221; She would not feel
safe until she was in the tram.</p>
<p>A face appeared at one of the windows.
As the vehicle turned the corner, the face vanished;
and perhaps that particular visage disappeared
forever. A gray wig came off, the
little gray side-whiskers, the bushy grey eyebrows,
revealing a clever face, not more than
thirty, cunning, but humorously cunning and
anything but scoundrelly. The painted scar
aslant the nose was also obliterated. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
haste the man thrust the evidences of disguise
into a traveling-bag, ran here and there
through the rooms, all bare and unfurnished
save the one with the bars and the kitchen,
which contained two cots and some cooking
utensils. Nothing of importance had been
left behind. He locked the door and ran all
the way to the Place d&#8217;Armes, catching the
tram to Paris by a fraction of a minute.</p>
<p>All very well done. She would be in Paris
before the police made any definite move.
The one thing that disturbed him was the
thought of the blockhead of a chauffeur, who
had got drunk before his return from Versailles.
If he talked; well, he could say nothing
beyond the fact that he had deposited the
singer at the house as directed. He knew
positively nothing.</p>
<p>The man laughed softly. A thousand
francs apiece for him and Antoine, and no
possible chance of being discovered. Let the
police find the house in Versailles; let them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
trace whatever paths they found; the agent
would tell them, and honestly, that an aged
man had rented the house for a month and
had paid him in advance. What more could
the agent say? Only one bit of puzzlement:
why hadn&#8217;t the blond stranger appeared?
Who was he, in truth, and what had been
his game? All this waiting and wondering,
and then a curt telegram of the night before,
saying, &#8220;Release her.&#8221; So much the
better. What his employer&#8217;s motives were did
not interest him half so much as the fact that
he had a thousand francs in his pocket, and
that all element of danger had been done away
with. True, the singer herself would move
heaven and earth to find out who had been
back of the abduction. Let her make her accusations.
He was out of it.</p>
<p>He glanced toward the forward part of the
tram. There she sat, staring at the white road
ahead. A young Frenchman sat near her,
curling his mustache desperately. So beautiful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
and all alone! At length he spoke to her.
She whirled upon him so suddenly that his hat
fell off his head and rolled at the feet of the
onlooker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your hat, Monsieur?&#8221; he said gravely,
returning it.</p>
<p>Nora laughed maliciously. The author of
the abortive flirtation fled down to the body of
the tram.</p>
<p>And now there was no one on top but Nora
and her erstwhile jailer, whom she did not
recognize in the least.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; said the great policeman
soberly, &#8220;this is a grave accusation to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I make it, nevertheless,&#8221; replied Nora.
She sat stiffly in her chair, her face colorless,
dark circles under her eyes. She never looked
toward Courtlandt.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Monsieur Courtlandt has offered an
alibi such as we can not ignore. More than
that, his integrity is vouched for by the gentleman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
at his side, whom doubtless Mademoiselle
recognizes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora eyed the great man doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the gentleman to you?&#8221; she was
interrogated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely nothing,&#8221; contemptuously.</p>
<p>The minister inspected his rings.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has annoyed me at various times,&#8221;
continued Nora; &#8220;that is all. And his actions
on Friday night warrant every suspicion I
have entertained against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief of police turned toward the bandaged
chauffeur. &#8220;You recognize the gentleman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Monsieur, I never saw him before.
It was an old man who engaged me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said that Mademoiselle&#8217;s old teacher
was very ill and asked for assistance. I left
Mademoiselle at the house and drove away.
I was hired from the garage. That is the
truth, Monsieur.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Nora smiled disbelievingly. Doubtless he
had been paid well for that lie.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; asked the chief of Nora&#8217;s
chauffeur.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is certainly the gentleman, Monsieur,
who attempted to bribe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Courtlandt with utmost
calmness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, if Monsieur Courtlandt
wished, he could accuse you of attempting to
shoot him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an accident. His sudden appearance
in my apartment frightened me. Besides,
I believe a woman who lives comparatively
alone has a legal and moral right to protect
herself from such unwarrantable intrusions.
I wish him no physical injury, but I am determined
to be annoyed by him no longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s eyes sought Courtlandt&#8217;s face
obliquely. Strange young man, he thought.
From the expression of his face he might have
been a spectator rather than the person most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
vitally concerned in this little scene. And
what a pair they made!</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur Courtlandt, you will give me
your word of honor not to annoy Mademoiselle
again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise never to annoy her again.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the briefest moment the blazing blue
eyes clashed with the calm brown ones. The
latter were first to deviate from the line. It
was not agreeable to look into a pair of eyes
burning with the hate of one&#8217;s self. Perhaps
this conflagration was intensified by the placidity
of his gaze. If only there had been some
sign of anger, of contempt, anything but this
incredible tranquillity against which she longed
to cry out! She was too wrathful to notice
the quickening throb of the veins on his
temples.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, I find no case against Monsieur
Courtlandt, unless you wish to appear
against him for his forcible entrance to your
apartment.&#8221; Nora shook her head. The chief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
of police stroked his mustache to hide the fleeting
smile. A peculiar case, the like of which
had never before come under his scrutiny!
&#8220;Circumstantial evidence, we know, points to
him; but we have also an alibi which is incontestable.
We must look elsewhere for your abductors.
Think; have you not some enemy?
Is there no one who might wish you worry and
inconvenience? Are your associates all loyal
to you? Is there any jealousy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, none at all, Monsieur,&#8221; quickly and
decidedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion, then, the whole affair is a
hoax, perpetrated to vex and annoy you. The
old man who employed this chauffeur may not
have been old. I have looked upon all sides
of the affair, and it begins to look like a practical
joke, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; angrily. &#8220;And am I to have no
redress? Think of the misery I have gone
through, the suspense! My voice is gone. I
shall not be able to sing again for months. Is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
it your suggestion that I drop the investigation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mademoiselle, for it does not look
as if we could get anywhere with it. If you
insist, I will hold Monsieur Courtlandt; but I
warn you the magistrate would not hesitate to
dismiss the case instantly. Monsieur Courtlandt
arrived in Marseilles Thursday morning;
he reached Paris Friday morning. Since arriving
in Paris he has fully accounted for his
time. It is impossible that he could have arranged
for the abduction. Still, if you say, I
can hold him for entering your apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be but a farce.&#8221; Nora rose.
&#8220;Monsieur, permit me to wish you good day.
For my part, I shall pursue this matter to the
end. I believe this gentleman guilty, and I
shall do my best to prove it. I am a woman,
and all alone. When a man has powerful
friends, it is not difficult to build an alibi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a reflection upon my word, Mademoiselle,&#8221;
quietly interposed the minister.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur has been imposed upon.&#8221; Nora
walked to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, Mademoiselle,&#8221; said the
prefect. &#8220;Why do you insist upon prosecuting
him for something of which he is guiltless,
when you could have him held for
something of which he is really guilty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one is trivial; the other is a serious
outrage. Good morning.&#8221; The attendant
closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;A very determined young woman,&#8221; mused
the chief of police.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exceedingly,&#8221; agreed the minister.</p>
<p>Courtlandt got up wearily. But the chief
motioned him to be reseated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not say that I dare not pursue my
investigations; but now that mademoiselle is
safely returned, I prefer not to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask who made this request?&#8221; asked
Courtlandt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Request? Yes, Monsieur, it was a request
not to proceed further.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;From where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As to that, you will have to consult the
head of the state. I am not at liberty to make
the disclosure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minister leaned forward eagerly.
&#8220;Then there is a political side to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There would be if everything had not
turned out so fortunately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that I understand now,&#8221; said
Courtlandt, his face hardening. Strange, he
had not thought of it before. His skepticism
had blinded him to all but one angle. &#8220;Your
advice to drop the matter is excellent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief of police elevated his brows interrogatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;For I presume,&#8221; continued Courtlandt,
rising, &#8220;that Mademoiselle&#8217;s abductor is by
this time safely across the frontier.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>BATTLING JIMMIE</h3>
</div>

<p>There is a heavenly terrace, flanked by
marvelous trees. To the left, far down
below, is a curving, dark-shaded, turquoise
body of water called Lecco; to the right there
lies the queen of lakes, the crown of Italy,
a corn-flower sapphire known as Como. Over
and about it&mdash;this terrace&mdash;poets have raved
and tousled their neglected locks in vain to
find the perfect phrasing; novelists have come
and gone and have carried away peace and inspiration;
and painters have painted it from
a thousand points of view, and perhaps are
painting it from another thousand this very
minute. It is the Place of Honeymoons.
Rich lovers come and idle there; and lovers of
modest means rush up to it and down from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
it to catch the next steamer to Menaggio.
Eros was not born in Greece: of all barren
mountains, unstirring, Hymettus, or Olympus,
or whatever they called it in the days of the
junketing gods, is completest. No; Venus
went a-touring and abode a while upon this
same gracious spot, once dear to Pliny the
younger.</p>
<p>Between the blessed ledge and the towering
mountains over the way, rolls a small valley,
caressed on either side by the lakes. There
are flower gardens, from which in summer
rises the spicy perfume of lavender; there are
rows upon rows of grape-vines, terraced
downward; there are purple figs and white and
ruby mulberries. Around and about, rising
sheer from the waters, wherever the eye may
rove, heaven-touching, salmon-tinted mountains
abound, with scarfs of filmy cloud aslant
their rugged profiles, and beauty-patches of
snow. And everywhere the dark and brooding
cypress, the copper beech, the green pine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
accentuate the pink and blue and white stucco
of the villas, the rich and the humble.</p>
<p>Behind the terrace is a promontory, three
or four hundred feet above the waters.
Upon the crest is a cultivated forest of all
known evergreens. There are ten miles of
cool and fragrant paths, well trodden by the
devoteés of Eros. The call of love is heard
here; the echoes to-day reverberate with the
impassioned declarations of yesterday. The
Englishman&#8217;s reserve melts, the American forgets
his coupons, the German puts his arm
around the robust waist of his frau or fräulein.
(This is nothing for him; he does it
unconcernedly up and down the great urban
highways of the world.)</p>
<p>Again, between the terrace ledge and the
forest lies a square of velvet green, abounding
in four-leaf clover. <i>Buona fortuna!</i> In
the center there is a fountain. The water
tinkles in drops. One hears its soft music at
all times. Along the terrace parapet are tea-tables;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
a monster oak protects one from the
sun. If one (or two) lingers over tea and
cakes, one may witness the fiery lances of the
setting sun burn across one arm of water
while the silver spars of the rising moon shimmer
across the other. Nature is whole-souled
here; she gives often and freely and all she
has.</p>
<p>Seated on one of the rustic benches, his
white tennis shoes resting against the lower
iron of the railing, a Bavarian dachel snoozing
comfortably across his knees, was a man
of fifty. He was broad of shoulder, deep of
chest, and clean-shaven. He had laid aside
his Panama hat, and his hair was clipped
closely, and was pleasantly and honorably
sprinkled with gray. His face was broad and
tanned; the nose was tilted, and the wide
mouth was both kindly and humorous. One
knew, from the tint of his blue eyes and the
quirk of his lips, that when he spoke there
would be a bit of brogue. He was James
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Harrigan, one time celebrated in the ring for
his gameness, his squareness, his endurance;
&#8220;Battling Jimmie&#8221; Harrigan, who, when he
encountered his first knock-out, retired from
the ring. He had to his credit sixty-one battles,
of which he had easily won forty. He
had been outpointed in some and had broken
even in others; but only once had he been
&#8220;railroaded into dreamland,&#8221; to use the
parlance of the game. That was enough.
He understood. Youth would be served, and
he was no longer young. He had, unlike the
many in his peculiar service, lived cleanly and
with wisdom and foresight: he had saved
both his money and his health. To-day he
was at peace with the world, with three sound
appetites the day and the wherewithal to
gratify them.</p>
<p>True, he often dreamed of the old days, the
roped square, the lights, the haze of tobacco
smoke, the white patches surrounding, all of
a certain expectant tilt, the reporters scribbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
on the deal tables under the very posts, the
cheers as he took his corner and scraped his
shoes in the powdered resin, the padded gloves
thrown down in the center of the canvas which
was already scarred and soiled by the preliminaries.
But never, never again; if only
for the little woman&#8217;s sake. Only when the
game was done did he learn with what terror
and dread she had waited for his return on
fighting nights.</p>
<p>To-day &#8220;Battling Jimmie&#8221; was forgotten
by the public, and he was happy in the seclusion
of this forgetfulness. A new and
strange career had opened up before him: he
was the father of the most beautiful prima
donna in the operatic world, and, difficult as
the task was, he did his best to live up to it.
It was hard not to offer to shake hands when
he was presented to a princess or a duchess;
it was hard to remember when to change the
studs in his shirt; and a white cravat was the
terror of his nights, for his fingers, broad and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
stubby and powerful, had not been trained to
the delicate task of tying a bow-knot. By a
judicious blow in that spot where the ribs
divaricate he could right well tie his adversary
into a bow-knot, but this string of white lawn
was a most damnable thing. Still, the puttering
of the two women, their daily concern
over his deportment, was bringing him into
conformity with social usages. That he
naturally despised the articles of such a soulless
faith was evident in his constant inclination
to play hooky. One thing he rebelled
against openly, and with such firmness that
the women did not press him too strongly for
fear of a general revolt. On no occasion,
however impressive, would he wear a silk hat.
Christmas and birthdays invariably called
forth the gift of a silk hat, for the women
trusted that they could overcome resistance
by persistence. He never said anything, but
it was noticed that the hotel porter, or the
gardener, or whatever masculine head (save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
his own) was available, came forth resplendent
on feast-days and Sundays.</p>
<p>Leaning back in an iron chair, with his
shoulders resting against the oak, was another
man, altogether a different type. He was
frowning over the pages of Bagot&#8217;s <i>Italian
Lakes</i>, and he wasn&#8217;t making much headway.
He was Italian to the core, for all that he aped
the English style and manner. He could
speak the tongue with fluency, but he
stumbled and faltered miserably over the
soundless type. His clothes had the Piccadilly
cut, and his mustache, erstwhile waxed
and militant, was cropped at the corners,
thoroughly insular. He was thirty, and undeniably
handsome.</p>
<p>Near the fountain, on the green, was a third
man. He was in the act of folding up an
easel and a camp-stool.</p>
<p>The tea-drinkers had gone. It was time for
the first bell for dinner. The villa&#8217;s omnibus
was toiling up the winding road among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
grape-vines. Suddenly Harrigan tilted his
head sidewise, and the long silken ears of the
dachel stirred. The Italian slowly closed his
book and permitted his chair to settle on its
four legs. The artist stood up from his paintbox.
From a window in the villa came a
voice; only a lilt of a melody, no words,&mdash;half
a dozen bars from <i>Martha</i>; but every delightful
note went deep into the three masculine
hearts. Harrigan smiled and patted the dog.
The Italian scowled at the vegetable garden
directly below. The artist scowled at the
Italian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fritz, Fritz; here, Fritz!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog struggled in Harrigan&#8217;s hands and
tore himself loose. He went clattering over
the path toward the villa and disappeared into
the doorway. Nothing could keep him when
that voice called. He was as ardent a lover
as any, and far more favored.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you funny little dog! You merry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
little dachel! Fritz, mustn&#8217;t; let go!&#8221; Silence.</p>
<p>The artist knew that she was cuddling the
puppy to her heart, and his own grew twisted.
He stooped over his materials again and tied
the box to the easel and the stool, and shifted
them under his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be up after dinner, Mr. Harrigan,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Abbott.&#8221; Harrigan waved his
hand pleasantly. He was becoming so used to
the unvarying statement that Abbott would be
up after dinner, that his reply was by now
purely mechanical. &#8220;She&#8217;s getting her voice
back all right; eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beautifully! But I really don&#8217;t think she
ought to sing at the Haines&#8217; villa Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One song won&#8217;t hurt her. She&#8217;s made up
her mind to sing. There&#8217;s nothing for us to
do but to sit tight. No news from Paris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, do you know what I think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one has come across to the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paris is not New York, Mr. Harrigan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s a hundred
cents to the dollar, my boy, Paris or New
York. Why haven&#8217;t they moved? They
can&#8217;t tell me that tow-headed chap&#8217;s alibi was
on the level. I wish I&#8217;d been in Paris.
There&#8217;d been something doing. And who was
he? They refuse to give his name. And I
can&#8217;t get a word out of Nora. Shuts me up
with a bang when I mention it. Throws her
nerves all out, she says. I&#8217;d like to get my
hands on the blackguard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So would I. It&#8217;s a puzzle. If he had
molested her while she was a captive, you
could understand. But he never came near
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Busted his nerve, that&#8217;s what.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have my doubts about that. A man who
will go that far isn&#8217;t subject to any derangement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
of his nerves. Want me to bring up the
checkers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;ve got two rubbers hanging over
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The artist took the path that led around
the villa and thence down by many steps to
the village by the waterside, to the cream-tinted
cluster of shops and enormous hotels.</p>
<p>The Italian was more fortunate. He was
staying at the villa. He rose and sauntered
over to Harrigan, who was always a source of
interest to him. Study the man as he might,
there always remained a profound mystery to
his keen Italian mind. Every now and then
nature&mdash;to prove that while she provided laws
for humanity she obeyed none herself&mdash;nature
produced the prodigy. Ancestry was nothing;
habits, intelligence, physical appearance counted
for naught. Harrigan was a fine specimen of
the physical man, yes; but to be the father of
a woman who was as beautiful as the legendary
goddesses and who possessed a voice incomparable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
in the living history of music, here
logic, the cold and accurate intruder, found
an unlockable door. He liked the ex-prizefighter,
so kindly and wholesome; but he also
pitied him. Harrigan reminded him of a seal
he had once seen in an aquarium tank: out of
his element, but merry-eyed and swimming
round and round as if determined to please
everybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a fine night,&#8221; said the Italian,
pausing at Harrigan&#8217;s bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every night is fine here, Barone,&#8221; replied
Harrigan. &#8220;Why, they had me up in Marienbad
a few weeks ago, and I&#8217;m not over it yet.
It&#8217;s no place for a sick man; only a well man
could come out of it alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Barone laughed. Harrigan had told
this tale half a dozen times, but each time the
Barone felt called on to laugh. The man was
her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Mr. Harrigan, Miss Harrigan
is not herself? She is&mdash;what do you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
call?&mdash;bitter. She laughs, but&mdash;ah, I do
not know!&mdash;it sounds not real.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she isn&#8217;t over that rumpus in Paris
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rumpus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The abduction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! Rumpus is another word for
abduction? Yes, yes, I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! Rumpus is just a mix-up, a row,
anything that makes a noise, calls in the police.
You can make a rumpus on the piano, over
a game of cards, anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Barone spread his hands. &#8220;I comprehend,&#8221;
hurriedly. He comprehended nothing,
but he was too proud to admit it.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Nora is not herself; a case of nerves.
And to think that you called there at the
apartment the very day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, if I had been there the right time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what puts me down for the count is
the action of the fellow. Never showed up;
just made her miss two performances.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He was afraid. Men who do cowardly
things are always afraid.&#8221; The Barone spoke
with decided accent, but he seldom made a
grammatical error. &#8220;But sometimes, too, men
grow mad at once, and they do things in their
madness. Ah, she is so beautiful! She is a
nightingale.&#8221; The Italian looked down on
Como whose broad expanse was crisscrossed
by rippled paths made by arriving and departing
steamers. &#8220;It is not a wonder that some
man might want to run away with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrigan looked curiously at the other.
&#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t be healthy for any man to try
it again.&#8221; The father held out his powerful
hands for the Barone&#8217;s inspection. They
called mutely but expressively for the throat
of the man who dared. &#8220;It&#8217;ll never happen
again. Her mother and I are not going away
from her any more. When she sings in Berlin,
I&#8217;m going to trail along; when she hits the
high note in Paris, I&#8217;m lingering near; when
she trills in London, I&#8217;m hiding in the shadow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
And you may put that in your pipe and smoke
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I smoke only cigarettes,&#8221; replied the
Barone gravely. It had been difficult to follow,
this English.</p>
<p>Harrigan said nothing in return. He had
given up trying to explain to the Italian the
idiomatic style of old Broadway. He got up
and brushed his flannels perfunctorily.
&#8220;Well, I suppose I&#8217;ve got to dress for supper,&#8221;
resentfully. He still called it supper;
and, as in the matter of the silk hat, his wife
no longer strove to correct him. The evening
meal had always been supper, and so it would
remain until that time when he would cease
to look forward to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you go to the dancing at Cadenabbia
to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? I should say not!&#8221; Harrigan
laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;d look like a bull in a china-shop.
Abbott is coming up to play checkers with me.
I&#8217;ll leave the honors to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>The Barone&#8217;s face lighted considerably.
He hated the artist only when he was visible.
He was rather confused, however. Abbott
had been invited to the dance. Why wasn&#8217;t
he going? Could it be true? Had the artist
tried his luck and lost? Ah, if fate were as
kind as that! He let Harrigan depart alone.</p>
<p>Why not? What did he care? What if
the father had been a fighter for prizes?
What if the mother was possessed with a
misguided desire to shine socially? What
mattered it if they had once resided in an obscure
tenement in a great city, and that grandfathers
were as far back as they could go
with any certainty? Was he not his own
master? What titled woman of his acquaintance
whose forebears had been powerful in
the days of the Borgias, was not dimmed in
the presence of this wonderful maid to whom
all things had been given unreservedly? Her
brow was fit for a royal crown, let alone a
simple baronial tiara such as he could provide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
The mother favored him a little; of this he
was reasonably certain; but the moods of the
daughter were difficult to discover or to
follow.</p>
<p>To-night! The round moon was rising
palely over Lecco; the moon, mistress of love
and tides, toward whom all men and maids
must look, though only Eros knows why!
Evidently there was no answer to the Italian&#8217;s
question, for he faced about and walked moodily
toward the entrance. Here he paused,
looking up at the empty window. Again a
snatch of song&mdash;</p>
<p><i>O solo mio</i> ... <i>che bella cosa</i>...!</p>
<p>What a beautiful thing indeed! Passionately
he longed for the old days, when by his
physical prowess alone oft a man won his lady.
Diplomacy, torrents of words, sly little tricks,
subterfuges, adroitness, stolen glances, careless
touches of the hand; by these must a maid
be won to-day. When she was happy she
sang, when she was sad, when she was only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
mischievous. She was just as likely to sing
<i>O terra addio</i> when she was happy as <i>O sole
mio</i> when she was sad. So, how was a man
to know the right approach to her variant
moods? Sighing deeply, he went on to his
room, to change his Piccadilly suit for another
which was supposed to be the last word in the
matter of evening dress.</p>
<p>Below, in the village, a man entered the
Grand Hotel. He was tall, blond, rosy-cheeked.
He carried himself like one used to
military service; also, like one used to giving
peremptory orders. The porter bowed, the
director bowed, and the proprietor himself
became a living carpenter&#8217;s square, hinged.
The porter and the director recognized a personage;
the proprietor recognized the man.
It was of no consequence that the new arrival
called himself Herr Rosen. He was assigned
to a suite of rooms, and on returning to the
bureau, the proprietor squinted his eyes abstractedly.
He knew every woman of importance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
at that time residing on the Point. Certainly
it could be none of these. <i>Himmel!</i>
He struck his hands together. So that was
it: the singer. He recalled the hints in certain
newspaper paragraphs, the little tales with
the names left to the imagination. So that
was it?</p>
<p>What a woman! Men looked at her and
went mad. And not so long ago one had abducted
her in Paris. The proprietor threw up
his hands in despair. What was going to happen
to the peace of this bucolic spot? The
youth permitted nothing to stand in his way,
and the singer&#8217;s father was a retired fighter
with boxing-gloves!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>MOONLIGHT AND A PRINCE</h3>
</div>

<p>When he had fought what he considered
two rattling rounds, Harrigan conceded
that his cravat had once more got the
decision over him on points. And the cravat
was only a second-rater, too, a black-silk
affair. He tossed up the sponge and went
down to the dining-room, the ends of the conqueror
straggling like the four points of a
battered weather-vane. His wife and daughter
and Mademoiselle Fournier were already
at their table by the casement window, from
which they could see the changing granite
mask of Napoleon across Lecco.</p>
<p>At the villa there were seldom more than
ten or twelve guests, this being quite the
capacity of the little hotel. These generally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
took refuge here in order to escape the noise
and confusion of a large hotel, to avoid the
necessity of dining in state every night. Few
of the men wore evening dress, save on occasions
when they were entertaining. The
villa wasn&#8217;t at all fashionable, and the run of
American tourists fought shy of it, preferring
the music and dancing and card-playing of the
famous hostelries along the water-front. Of
course, everybody came up for the view, just
as everybody went up the Corner Grat (by
cable) at Zermatt to see the Matterhorn.
But for all its apparent dulness, there, was
always an English duchess, a Russian princess,
or a lady from the Faubourg St.-Germain
somewhere about, resting after a strenuous
winter along the Riviera. Nora Harrigan
sought it not only because she loved the spot,
but because it sheltered her from idle curiosity.
It was almost as if the villa were hers, and the
other people her guests.</p>
<p>Harrigan crossed the room briskly, urged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
by an appetite as sound as his views on life.
The chef here was a king; there was always
something to look forward to at the dinner
hour; some new way of serving spinach, or
lentils, or some irresistible salad. He smiled
at every one and pulled out his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you folks waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;James!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; he asked good-naturedly.
Never that tone but something
was out of kilter.</p>
<p>His wife glanced wrathfully at his feet.
Wonderingly he looked down. In the heat of
the battle with his cravat he had forgotten
all about his tennis shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. No soup for mine.&#8221; He went
back to his room, philosophically. There was
always something wrong when he got into
these infernal clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Nora, &#8220;why can&#8217;t you let
him be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But white shoes!&#8221; in horror.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who cares? He&#8217;s the patientest man I
know. We&#8217;re always nagging him, and I for
one am going to stop. Look about! So few
men and women dress for dinner. You do
as you please here, and that is why I like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never be able to do anything with
him as long as he sees that his mistakes are
being condoned by you,&#8221; bitterly responded the
mother. &#8220;Some day he will humiliate us all
by his carelessness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bother!&#8221; Nora&#8217;s elbow slyly dug
into Celeste&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>The pianist&#8217;s pretty face was bent over
her soup. She had grown accustomed to these
little daily rifts. For the great, patient,
clumsy, happy-go-lucky man she entertained
an intense pity. But it was not the kind that
humiliates; on the contrary, it was of a
mothering disposition; and the ex-gladiator
dimly recognized it, and felt more comfortable
with her than with any other woman excepting
Nora. She understood him perhaps better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
than either mother or daughter; he was
too late: he belonged to a distant time, the
beginning of the Christian era; and often she
pictured him braving the net and the trident
in the saffroned arena.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harrigan broke her bread vexatiously.
Her husband refused to think for himself, and
it was wearing on her nerves to watch him day
and night. Deep down under the surface of
new adjustments and social ambitions, deep in
the primitive heart, he was still her man. But
it was only when he limped with an occasional
twinge of rheumatism, or a tooth ached, or
he dallied with his meals, that the old love-instinct
broke up through these artificial
crustations. True, she never knew how often
he invented these trivial ailments, for he soon
came into the knowledge that she was less
concerned about him when he was hale and
hearty. She still retained evidences of a
blossomy beauty. Abbott had once said truly
that nature had experimented on her; it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
in the reproduction that perfection had been
reached. To see the father, the mother, and
the daughter together it was not difficult to
fashion a theory as to the latter&#8217;s splendid
health and physical superiority. Arriving at
this point, however, theory began to fray at
the ends. No one could account for the genius
and the voice. The mother often stood lost
in wonder that out of an ordinary childhood,
a barelegged, romping, hoydenish childhood,
this marvel should emerge: her&#8217;s!</p>
<p>She was very ambitious for her daughter.
She wanted to see nothing less than a ducal
coronet upon the child&#8217;s brow, British preferred.
If ordinary chorus girls and vaudeville
stars, possessing only passable beauty and
no intelligence whatever, could bring earls into
their nets, there was no reason why Nora
could not be a princess or a duchess. So she
planned accordingly. But the child puzzled
and eluded her; and from time to time she
discovered a disquieting strength of character
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
behind a disarming amiability. Ever
since Nora had returned home by way of the
Orient, the mother had recognized a subtle
change, so subtle that she never had an opportunity
of alluding to it verbally. Perhaps
the fault lay at her own door. She should
never have permitted Nora to come abroad
alone to fill her engagements.</p>
<p>But that Nora was to marry a duke was,
to her mind, a settled fact. It is a peculiar
phase, this of the humble who find themselves,
without effort of their own, thrust up among
the great and the so-called, who forget whence
they came in the fierce contest for supremacy
upon that tottering ledge called society. The
cad and the snob are only infrequently well-born.
Mrs. Harrigan was as yet far from
being a snob, but it required some tact upon
Nora&#8217;s part to prevent this dubious accomplishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Abbott going with us?&#8221; she inquired.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Donald is sulking,&#8221; Nora answered.
&#8220;For once the Barone got ahead of him in
engaging the motor-boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would not call him by his first
name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not? I like him, and he is a
very good comrade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not call the Barone by his given
name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens, no! If I did he would kiss me.
These Italians will never understand western
customs, mother. I shall never marry an
Italian, much as I love Italy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor a Frenchman?&#8221; asked Celeste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor a Frenchman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew if you meant it,&#8221; sighed
the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, I have given myself to the stage.
You will never see me being led to the altar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you will do the leading when the time
comes,&#8221; retorted the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, the men I like you may count
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
upon the fingers of one hand. Three of them
are old. For the rest, I despise men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose some day you will marry some
poverty-stricken artist,&#8221; said the mother, filled
with dark foreboding.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not call Donald poverty-stricken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But you will never marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I never shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Celeste smoothed her hands, a little trick she
had acquired from long hours spent at the
piano. &#8220;He will make some woman a good
husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That he will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he is most desperately in love with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nonsense!&#8221; scoffed Nora. &#8220;He
thinks he is. He ought to fall in love with
you, Celeste. Every time you play the fourth
<i>ballade</i> he looks as if he was ready to throw
himself at your feet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Pouf!</i> For ten minutes?&#8221; Celeste
laughed bravely. &#8220;He leaves me quickly
enough when you begin to sing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glamour, glamour!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should not care for the article
second-hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrival of Harrigan put an end to this
dangerous trend of conversation. He walked
in tight proper pumps, and sat down. He was
only hungry now; the zest for dining was
gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go sitting out in the night air,
Nora,&#8221; he warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t dance more than you ought to.
Your mother would let you wear the soles off
your shoes if she thought you were attracting
attention. Don&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;James, that is not true,&#8221; the mother protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Molly, you do like to hear &#8217;em talk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
I wish they knew how to cook a good club
steak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought up a book from the village for
you to-day,&#8221; said Mrs. Harrigan, sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a dollar it&#8217;s on how to keep the
creases in a fellow&#8217;s pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trousers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pants,&#8221; helping himself to the last of the
romaine. &#8220;What time do you go over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At nine. We must be getting ready now,&#8221;
said Nora. &#8220;Don&#8217;t wait up for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And only one cigar,&#8221; added the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Molly, you keep closing in on me.
Tobacco won&#8217;t hurt me any, and I get a good
deal of comfort out of it these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two,&#8221; smiled Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;But his heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what in mercy&#8217;s name is the matter
with his heart? The doctor at Marienbad
said that father was the soundest man of his
age he had ever met.&#8221; Nora looked quizzically
at her father.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>He grinned. Out of his own mouth he had
been nicely trapped. That morning he had
complained of a little twinge in his heart, a
childish subterfuge to take Mrs. Harrigan&#8217;s
attention away from the eternal society page
of the <i>Herald</i>. It had succeeded. He had
even been cuddled.</p>
<p>&#8220;James, you told me...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Molly, I only wanted to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To do so it isn&#8217;t necessary to frighten me
to death,&#8221; reproachfully. &#8220;One cigar, and no
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Molly, what ails you?&#8221; as they left the
dining-room. &#8220;Nora&#8217;s right. That sawbones
said I was made of iron. I&#8217;m only smoking
native cigars, and it takes a bunch of &#8217;em to
get the taste of tobacco. All right; in a few
months you&#8217;ll have me with the stuffed canary
under the glass top. What&#8217;s the name of that
book?&#8221; diplomatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Social Usages.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Break away!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>Nora laughed. &#8220;But, dad, you really must
read it carefully. It will tell you how to talk
to a duchess, if you chance to meet one
when I am not around. It has all the names
of the forks and knives and spoons, and it
tells you never to use sugar on your lettuce.&#8221;
And then she threw her arm around her
mother&#8217;s waist. &#8220;Honey, when you buy
books for father, be sure they are by Dumas
or Haggard or Doyle. Otherwise he will
never read a line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I try so hard!&#8221; Tears came into
Mrs. Harrigan&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, Molly, old girl!&#8221; soothed
the outlaw. &#8220;I&#8217;ll read the book. I know I&#8217;m
a stupid old stumbling-block, but it&#8217;s hard to
teach an old dog new tricks, that is, at the
ring of the gong. Run along to your party.
And don&#8217;t break any more hearts than you
need, Nora.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora promised in good faith. But once in
the ballroom, that little son of Satan called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
malice-aforethought took possession of her;
and there was havoc. If a certain American
countess had not patronized her; if certain
lorgnettes (implements of torture used by
said son of Satan) had not been leveled in
her direction; if certain fans had not been
suggestively spread between pairs of feminine
heads,&mdash;Nora would have been as harmless
as a playful kitten.</p>
<p>From door to door of the ballroom her
mother fluttered like a hen with a duckling.
Even Celeste was disturbed, for she saw that
Nora&#8217;s conduct was not due to any light-hearted
fun. There was something bitter and
ironic cloaked by those smiles, that tinkle of
laughter. In fact, Nora from Tuscany
flirted outrageously. The Barone sulked and
tore at his mustache. He committed any
number of murders, by eye and by wish.
When his time came to dance with the mischief-maker,
he whirled her around savagely,
and never said a word; and once done with,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
he sternly returned her to her mother, which
he deemed the wisest course to pursue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora, you are behaving abominably!&#8221;
whispered her mother, pale with indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am having a good time ...
Your dance? Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And a tender young American led her
through the mazes of the waltz, as some poet
who knew what he was about phrased it.</p>
<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that there
was not a woman in the ballroom to compare
with her, and some of them were marvelously
gowned and complexioned, too. She overshadowed
them not only by sheer beauty, but
by exuberance of spirit. And they followed
her with hating eyes and whispered scandalous
things behind their fans and wondered what
had possessed the Marchesa to invite the bold
thing: so does mediocrity pay homage to
beauty and genius. As for the men, though
madness lay that way, eagerly as of old they
sought it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>By way of parenthesis: Herr Rosen
marched up the hill and down again, something
after the manner of a certain warrior
king celebrated in verse. The object of his
visit had gone to the ball at Cadenabbia. At
the hotel he demanded a motor-boat. There
was none to be had. In a furious state of
mind he engaged two oarsmen to row him
across the lake.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that when Nora,
suddenly grown weary of the play, full of bitterness
and distaste, hating herself and every
one else in the world, stole out to the quay
to commune with the moon, she saw him jump
from the boat to the landing, scorning the
steps. Instantly she drew her lace mantle
closely about her face. It was useless. In
the man the hunter&#8217;s instinct was much too
keen.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have found you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One would say that I had been in hiding?&#8221;
coldly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;From me, always. I have left everything&mdash;duty,
obligations&mdash;to seek you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From any other man that might be a compliment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a prince,&#8221; he said proudly.</p>
<p>She faced him with that quick resolution,
that swift forming of purpose, which has made
the Irish so difficult in argument and persuasion.
&#8220;Will you marry me? Will you
make me your wife legally? Before all the
world? Will you surrender, for the sake of
this love you profess, your right to a great inheritance?
Will you risk the anger and the
iron hand of your father for my sake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Herr Gott!</i> I am mad!&#8221; He covered
his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That expression proves that your Highness
is sane again. Have you realized the annoyances,
the embarrassments, you have thrust
upon me by your pursuit? Have you not read
the scandalous innuendoes in the newspapers?
Your Highness, I was not born on the Continent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
so I look upon my work from a point
of view not common to those of your caste.
I am proud of it, and I look upon it with
honor, honor. I am a woman, but I am not
wholly defenseless. There was a time when
I thought I might number among my friends
a prince; but you have made that impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said hoarsely; &#8220;let us go and
find a priest. You are right. I love you; I
will give up everything, everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment she was dumb. This absolute
surrender appalled her. But that good
fortune which had ever been at her side
stepped into the breach. And as she saw the
tall form of the Barone approach, she could
have thrown her arms around his neck in pure
gladness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Barone!&#8221; she called. &#8220;Am I making
you miss this dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not matter, Signorina.&#8221; The
Barone stared keenly at the erect and tense
figure at the prima donna&#8217;s side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse me, Herr Rosen,&#8221; said
Nora, as she laid her hand upon the Barone&#8217;s
arm.</p>
<p>Herr Rosen bowed stiffly; and the two left
him standing uncovered in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is he doing here? What has he
been saying to you?&#8221; the Barone demanded.
Nora withdrew her hand from his arm.
&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said he contritely. &#8220;I have no
right to ask you such questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not long after midnight when the
motor-boat returned to its abiding place. On
the way over conversation lagged, and finally
died altogether. Mrs. Harrigan fell asleep
against Celeste&#8217;s shoulder, and the musician
never deviated her gaze from the silver ripples
which flowed out diagonally and magically
from the prow of the boat. Nora watched the
stars slowly ascend over the eastern range of
mountains; and across the fire of his innumerable
cigarettes the Barone watched her.</p>
<p>As the boat was made fast to the landing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
in front of the Grand Hotel, Celeste observed
a man in evening dress, lounging against the
rail of the quay. The search-light from the
customs-boat, hunting for tobacco smugglers,
flashed over his face. She could not repress
the little gasp, and her hand tightened upon
Nora&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I thought I was slipping.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>COLONEL CAXLEY-WEBSTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Abbott&#8217;s studio was under the roof of
one of the little hotels that stand timorously
and humbly, yet expectantly, between
the imposing cream-stucco of the Grand Hotel
at one end and the elaborate pink-stucco of
the Grande Bretegne at the other. The hobnailed
shoes of the Teuton (who wears his
mountain kit all the way from Hamburg to
Palermo) wore up and down the stairs all
day; and the racket from the hucksters&#8217; carts
and hotel omnibuses, arriving and departing
from the steamboat landing, the shouts of the
begging boatmen, the quarreling of the children
and the barking of unpedigreed dogs,&mdash;these
noises were incessant from dawn until
sunset.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>The artist glared down from his square window
at the ruffled waters, or scowled at the
fleeting snows on the mountains over the way.
He passed some ten or twelve minutes in this
useless occupation, but he could not get away
from the bald fact that he had acted like a
petulant child. To have shown his hand so
openly, simply because the Barone had beaten
him in the race for the motor-boat! And
Nora would understand that he was weak and
without backbone. Harrigan himself must
have reasoned out the cause for such asinine
plays as he had executed in the game of
checkers. How many times had the old man
called out to him to wake up and move? In
spirit he had been across the lake, a spirit
in Hades. He was not only a fool, but a coward
likewise. He had not dared to</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;... put it to the touch</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>To gain or lose it all.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>He saw it coming: before long he and that
Italian would be at each other&#8217;s throats.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; he called, in response to a
sudden thunder on the door.</p>
<p>The door opened and a short, energetic old
man, purple-visaged and hawk-eyed, came in.
&#8220;Why the devil don&#8217;t you join the Trappist
monks, Abbott? If I wasn&#8217;t tough I should
have died of apoplexy on the second landing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Colonel!&#8221; Abbott
laughed and rolled out the patent rocker for
his guest. &#8220;What&#8217;s on your mind this morning?
I can give you one without ice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it neat, my boy. I&#8217;m not thirsty,
I&#8217;m faint. These Italian architects; they call
three ladders flights of stairs! ... Ha!
That&#8217;s Irish whisky, and jolly fine. Want you
to come over and take tea this afternoon. I&#8217;m
going up presently to see the Harrigans.
Thought I&#8217;d go around and do the thing informally.
Taken a fancy to the old chap.
He&#8217;s a little bit of all right. I&#8217;m no older
than he is, but look at the difference! Whisky
and soda, that&#8217;s the racket. Not by the tubful;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
just an ordinary half dozen a day, and
a dem climate thrown in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Difference in training.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot! It&#8217;s the sized hat a man wears. I&#8217;d
give fifty guineas to see the old fellow in action.
But, I say; recall the argument we had
before you went to Paris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I win. Saw him bang across the
street this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abbott muttered something.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounded like &#8216;dem it&#8217; to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard about him in Paris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old boy had transferred his regiment
to a lonesome post in the North to cool his
blood. The youngster took the next train to
Paris. He was there incognito for two weeks
before they found him and bundled him back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
Of course, every one knows that he is but a
crazy lad who&#8217;s had too much freedom.&#8221;
The colonel emptied his glass. &#8220;I feel dem
sorry for Nora. She&#8217;s the right sort. But a
woman can&#8217;t take a man by the scruff of his
neck and chuck him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can,&#8221; declared Abbott savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut! He&#8217;d eat you alive. Besides,
you will find him too clever to give you an opening.
But he&#8217;ll bear watching. He&#8217;s capable
of putting her on a train and running away
with her. Between you and me, I don&#8217;t blame
him. What&#8217;s the matter with sicking the
Barone on him? He&#8217;s the best man in Southern
Italy with foils and broadswords. Sic
&#8217;em, Towser; sic &#8217;em!&#8221; The old fire-eater
chuckled.</p>
<p>The subject was extremely distasteful to the
artist. The colonel, a rough soldier, whose
diplomacy had never risen above the heights
of clubbing a recalcitrant Hill man into submission,
baldly inferred that he understood the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
artist&#8217;s interest in the rose of the Harrigan
family. He would have liked to talk more in
regard to the interloper, but it would have been
sheer folly. The colonel, in his blundering
way, would have brought up the subject again
at tea-time and put everybody on edge. He
had, unfortunately for his friends, a reputation
other than that of a soldier: he posed as
a peacemaker. He saw trouble where none
existed, and the way he patched up imaginary
quarrels would have strained the patience of
Job. Still, every one loved him, though they
lived in mortal fear of him. So Abbott came
about quickly and sailed against the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wish you would
let me sketch that servant of yours. He&#8217;s got a
profile like a medallion. Where did you pick
him up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Hills. He&#8217;s a Sikh, and a first-class
fighting man. Didn&#8217;t know that you
went for faces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as a usual thing. Just want it for my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
own use. How does he keep his beard combed
that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never bothered myself about the curl
of his whiskers. Are my clothes laid out?
Luggage attended to? Guns shipshape?
That&#8217;s enough for me. Some day you have
got to go out there with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never shot a gun in all my life. I don&#8217;t
know which end to hold at my shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teach you quick enough. Every man&#8217;s a
born hunter. Rao will have tigers eating out
of your hand. He&#8217;s a marvel; saved my hide
more than once. Funny thing; you can&#8217;t
show &#8217;em that you&#8217;re grateful. Lose caste if
you do. I rather miss it. Get the East in
your blood and you&#8217;ll never get it out. Fascinating!
But my liver turned over once too
many times. Ha! Some one coming up to
buy a picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The step outside was firm and unwearied
by the climb. The door opened unceremoniously,
and Courtlandt came in. He stared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
at the colonel and the colonel returned the
stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Caxley-Webster! Well, I say, this globe
goes on shrinking every day!&#8221; cried Courtlandt.</p>
<p>The two pumped hands energetically, sizing
each other up critically. Then they sat down
and shot questions, while Abbott looked on
bewildered. Elephants and tigers and chittahs
and wild boar and quail-running and strange
guttural names; weltering nights in the jungles,
freezing mornings in the Hills; stupendous
card games; and what had become of
so-and-so, who always drank his whisky neat;
and what&#8217;s-his-name, who invented cures for
snake bites!</p>
<p>Abbott deliberately pushed over an oak
bench. &#8220;Am I host here or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abby, old man, how are you?&#8221; said
Courtlandt, smiling warmly and holding out
his hand. &#8220;My apologies; but the colonel
and I never expected to see each other again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
And I find him talking with you up here under
this roof. It&#8217;s marvelous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you wouldn&#8217;t drop a fellow
a line,&#8221; said Abbott, in a faultfinding tone, as
he righted the bench. &#8220;When did you
come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night. Came up from Como.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to stay long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends. I am really on my way to
Zermatt. I&#8217;ve a hankering to have another try
at the Matterhorn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of that!&#8221; exclaimed the colonel.
&#8220;He says another try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You came a roundabout way,&#8221; was the
artist&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s because I left Paris for Brescia.
They had some good flights there. Wonderful
year! They cross the Channel in an airship
and discover the North Pole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pah! Neither will be of any use to humanity;
merely a fine sporting proposition.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
The colonel dug into his pocket for his pipe.
&#8220;But what do you think of Germany?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine country,&#8221; answered Courtlandt, rising
and going to a window; &#8220;fine people, too.
Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you&mdash;er&mdash;think they could whip
us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On land, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On water, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. In other words, you believe our
chances equal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So equal that all this war-scare is piffle.
But I rather like to see you English get up in
the air occasionally. It will do you good.
You&#8217;ve an idea because you walloped Napoleon
that you&#8217;re the same race you were then,
and you are not. The English-speaking races,
as the first soldiers, have ceased to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I be dem!&#8221; gasped the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the truth. Take the American: he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
thinks there is nothing in the world but money.
Take the Britisher: to him caste is everything.
Take the money out of one man&#8217;s mind and
the importance of being well-born out of the
other....&#8221; He turned from the window
and smiled at the artist and the empurpling
Anglo-Indian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Abbott,&#8221; growled the soldier, &#8220;that man
will some day drive me amuck. What do you
think? One night, on a tiger hunt, he got me
into an argument like this. A brute of a beast
jumped into the middle of it. Courtlandt
shot him on the second bound, and turned to
me with&mdash;&#8216;Well, as I was saying!&#8217; I don&#8217;t
know to this day whether it was nerve or what
you Americans call gall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Divided by two,&#8221; grinned Abbott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, I see; half nerve and half gall. I&#8217;ll
remember that. But we were talking of airships.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; retorted Courtlandt. &#8220;You were
the man who started the powwow.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
looked down into the street with sudden interest.
&#8220;Who is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The colonel and Abbott hurried across the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I say, Abbott? I told you I
saw him. He&#8217;s crazy; fact. Thinks he can
travel around incognito when there isn&#8217;t a
magazine on earth that hasn&#8217;t printed his
picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why shouldn&#8217;t he travel around if he
wants to?&#8221; asked Courtlandt coolly.</p>
<p>The colonel nudged the artist.</p>
<p>&#8220;There happens to be an attraction in Bellaggio,&#8221;
said Abbott irritably.</p>
<p>&#8220;The moth and the candle,&#8221; supplemented
the colonel, peering over Courtlandt&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;He&#8217;s well set up,&#8221; grudgingly admitted
the old fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;The moth and the candle,&#8221; mused Courtlandt.
&#8220;That will be Nora Harrigan. How
long has this infatuation been going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Year and a half.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the other side?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any other side,&#8221; exploded the
artist. &#8220;She&#8217;s worried to death. Not a day
passes but some scurrilous penny-a-liner
springs some yarn, some beastly innuendo.
She&#8217;s been dodging the fellow for months.
In Paris last year she couldn&#8217;t move without
running into him. This year she changed her
apartment, and gave orders at the Opera to
refuse her address to all who asked for it.
Consequently she had some peace. I don&#8217;t
know why it is, but a woman in public life
seems to be a target.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The penalty of beauty, Abby. Homely
women seldom are annoyed, unless they become
suffragists.&#8221; The colonel poured forth
a dense cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What brand is that, Colonel?&#8221; asked
Courtlandt, choking.</p>
<p>The colonel generously produced his pouch.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I was about to observe that it
isn&#8217;t ambrosia.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Rotter!&#8221; The soldier dug the offender in
the ribs. &#8220;I am going to have the Harrigans
over for tea this afternoon. Come over!
You&#8217;ll like the family. The girl is charming;
and the father is a sportsman to the backbone.
Some silly fools laugh behind his back, but
never before his face. And my word, I know
rafts of gentlemen who are not fit to stand in
his shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to meet Mr. Harrigan.&#8221;
Courtlandt returned his gaze to the window
once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;And his daughter?&#8221; said Abbott, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, surely!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may count on you, then?&#8221; The colonel
stowed away the offending brier. &#8220;And you
can stay to dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the dinner end of the invitation,&#8221;
was the reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go over to
Menaggio to see about some papers to be
signed. If I can make the three o&#8217;clock boat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
in returning, you&#8217;ll see me at tea. Dinner at
all events. I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to stand there and tell me
that you have important business?&#8221; jeered
Abbott.</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy, the reason I&#8217;m on trains and
boats, year in and year out, is in the vain
endeavor to escape important business. Now
and then I am rounded up. Were you ever
hunted by money?&#8221; humorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the Englishman sadly.
&#8220;But I know one thing: I&#8217;d throw the race
at the starting-post. Millions, Abbott, and to
be obliged to run away from them! If the
deserts hadn&#8217;t dried up all my tears, I should
weep. Why don&#8217;t you hire a private secretary
to handle your affairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have him following at my heels?&#8221;
Courtlandt gazed at his lean brown hands.
&#8220;When these begin to shake, I&#8217;ll do so. Well,
I shall see you both at dinner, whatever happens.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Courtlandt,&#8221; said Abbott, when his
friend was gone. &#8220;You think he&#8217;s in Singapore,
the door opens and in he walks; never
any letter or announcement. He arrives,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strikes me,&#8221; returned the other, polishing
his glass, holding it up to the light, and
then screwing it into his eye; &#8220;strikes me, he
wasn&#8217;t overanxious to have that dish of tea.
Afraid of women?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of women! Why, man, he backed
two musical shows in the States a few years
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Musical comedies?&#8221; The glass dropped
from the colonel&#8217;s eye. &#8220;That&#8217;s going tigers
one better. Forty women, all waiting to be
stars, and solemn Courtlandt wandering
among them as the god of amity! Afraid of
them! Of course he is. Who wouldn&#8217;t be,
after such an experience?&#8221; The colonel
laughed. &#8220;Never had any serious affair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard of one. There was some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
tommy-rot about a Mahommedan princess in
the newspapers; but I knew there was no truth
in that. Queer fellow! He wouldn&#8217;t take the
trouble to deny it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never showed any signs of being a
woman-hater?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not the least in the world. But to
shy at meeting Nora Harrigan....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you have it; the privilege of the
gods. Perhaps he really has business in
Menaggio. What&#8217;ll we do with the other
beggar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Knock his head off, if he bothers her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better turn the job over to Courtlandt,
then. You&#8217;re in the light-weight class, and
Courtlandt is the best amateur for his weight
I ever saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, boxes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A tough &#8217;un. I had a corporal who beat
any one in Northern India. Courtlandt put
on the gloves with him and had him begging in
the third round.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew that before. He&#8217;s as full
of surprises as a rummage bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt walked up the street leisurely,
idly pausing now and then before the shop-windows.
Apparently he had neither object
nor destination; yet his mind was busy, so
busy in fact that he looked at the various
curios without truly seeing them at all. A
delicate situation, which needed the lightest
handling, confronted him. He must wait for
an overt act, then he might proceed as he
pleased. How really helpless he was! He
could not force her hand because she held all
the cards and he none. Yet he was determined
this time to play the game to the end,
even if the task was equal to all those of
Hercules rolled into one, and none of the gods
on his side.</p>
<p>At the hotel he asked for his mail, and was
given a formidable packet which, with a sigh
of discontent, he slipped into a pocket, strolled
out into the garden by the water, and sat down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
to read. To his surprise there was a note,
without stamp or postmark. He opened it,
mildly curious to learn who it was that had
discovered his presence in Bellaggio so quickly.
The envelope contained nothing more than a
neatly folded bank-note for one hundred
francs. He eyed it stupidly. What might
this mean? He unfolded it and smoothed it
out across his knee, and the haze of puzzlement
drifted away. Three bars from <i>La Bohème</i>.
He laughed. So the little lady of the Taverne
Royale was in Bellaggio!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>MARGUERITES AND EMERALDS</h3>
</div>

<p>From where he sat Courtlandt could see
down the main thoroughfare of the pretty
village. There were other streets, to be sure,
but courtesy and good nature alone permitted
this misapplication of title: they were merely
a series of torturous enervating stairways of
stone, up and down which noisy wooden
sandals clattered all the day long. Over the
entrances to the shops the proprietors were
dropping the white and brown awnings for the
day. Very few people shopped after luncheon.
There were pleasanter pastimes, even
for the women, contradictory as this may
seem. By eleven o&#8217;clock Courtlandt had
finished the reading of his mail, and was now
ready to hunt for the little lady of the Taverne
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Royale. It was necessary to find her. The
whereabouts of Flora Desimone was of vital
importance. If she had not yet arrived, the
presence of her friend presaged her ultimate
arrival. The duke was a negligible quantity.
It would have surprised Courtlandt could he
have foreseen the drawing together of the ends
of the circle and the relative concernment of
the duke in knotting those ends. The labors
of Hercules had never entailed the subjugation
of two temperamental women.</p>
<p>He rose and proceeded on his quest. Before
the photographer&#8217;s shop he saw a dachel
wrathfully challenging a cat on the balcony
of the adjoining building. The cat knew,
and so did the puppy, that it was all buncombe
on the puppy&#8217;s part: the usual European
war-scare, in which one of the belligerent
parties refused to come down because it
wouldn&#8217;t have been worth while, there being
the usual Powers ready to intervene. Courtlandt
did not bother about the cat; the puppy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
claimed his attention. He was very fond of
dogs. So he reached down suddenly and put
an end to the sharp challenge. The dachel
struggled valiantly, for this breed of dog does
not make friends easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, you little Dutchman, what&#8217;s the
row? I&#8217;m not going to hurt you. Funny
little codger! To whom do you belong?&#8221;
He turned the collar around, read the inscription,
and gently put the puppy on the ground.</p>
<p>Nora Harrigan!</p>
<p>His immediate impulse was to walk on, but
somehow this impulse refused to act on his
sense of locomotion. He waited, dully wondering
what was going to happen when she
came out. He had left her room that night
in Paris, vowing that he would never intrude
on her again. With the recollection of that
bullet whizzing past his ear, he had been convinced
that the play was done. True, she had
testified that it had been accidental, but never
would he forget the look in her eyes. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
not pleasant to remember. And still, as the
needle is drawn by the magnet, here he was,
in Bellaggio. He cursed his weakness. From
Brescia he had made up his mind to go directly
to Berlin. Before he realized how useless it
was to battle against these invisible forces, he
was in Milan, booking for Como. At Como
he had remained a week (the dullest week he
had ever known); at the Villa d&#8217;Este three
days; at Cadenabbia one day. It had all the
characteristics of a tug-of-war, and irresistibly
he was drawn over the line. The night before
he had taken the evening boat across the lake.
And Herr Rosen had been his fellow-passenger!
The goddess of chance threw whimsical
coils around her victims. To find himself
shoulder to shoulder, as it were, with
this man who, perhaps more than all other
incentives, had urged him to return again to
civilization; this man who had aroused in his
heart a sentiment that hitherto he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
not believed existed,&mdash;jealousy.... Ah,
voices! He stepped aside quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fritz, Fritz; where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>And a moment later she came out, followed
by her mother ... and the little lady of
the Taverne Royale. Did Nora see him? It
was impossible to tell. She simply stooped
and gathered up the puppy, who struggled determinedly
to lick her face. Courtlandt lifted
his hat. It was in nowise offered as an act
of recognition; it was merely the mechanical
courtesy that a man generally pays to any
woman in whose path he chances to be for the
breath of a second. The three women in immaculate
white, hatless, but with sunshades,
passed on down the street.</p>
<p>Courtlandt went into the shop, rather
blindly. He stared at the shelves of paper-covered
novels and post-cards, and when the
polite proprietor offered him a dozen of the
latter, he accepted them without comment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
Indeed, he put them into a pocket and turned
to go out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon, sir; those are one franc the
dozen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221; Courtlandt pulled out some
silver. It was going to be terribly difficult,
and his heart was heavy with evil presages.
He had seen Celeste. He understood the
amusing if mysterious comedy now. Nora
had recognized him and had sent her friend
to follow him and learn where he went. And
he, poor fool of a blunderer, with the best
intentions in the world, he had gone at once
to the Calabrian&#8217;s apartment! It was damnable
of fate. He had righted nothing. In
truth, he was deeper than ever in the quicksands
of misunderstanding. He shut his
teeth with a click. How neatly she had waylaid
and trapped him!</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are from Lucerne, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; bewildered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Those wood-carvings which you are
touching with your cane, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Courtlandt, apologetically,
and gained the open. He threw a
quick glance down the street. There they
were. He proceeded in the opposite direction,
toward his hotel. Tea at the colonel&#8217;s?
Scarcely. He would go to Menaggio with the
hotel motor-boat and return so late that he
would arrive only in time for dinner. He was
not going to meet the enemy over tea-cups, at
least, not under the soldier&#8217;s tactless supervision.
He must find a smoother way, calculated,
under the rose, but seemingly accidental.
It was something to ponder over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora, who was that?&#8221; asked Mrs. Harrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was who?&#8221; countered Nora, snuggling
the wriggling dachel under her arm and
throwing the sunshade across her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fine-looking young man who stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
by the door as we passed out. He raised his
hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bother! I was looking at Fritz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Celeste searched her face keenly, but Nora
looked on ahead serenely; not a quiver of an
eyelid, not the slightest change in color or expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not see him!&#8221; thought the musician,
curiously stirred. She knew her friend
tolerably well. It would have been impossible
for her to have seen that man and not to have
given evidence of the fact.</p>
<p>In short, Nora had spoken truthfully. She
had seen a man dressed in white flannels and
canvas shoes, but her eyes had not traveled so
far as his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, we must have some of those silk
blankets. They&#8217;re so comfy to lie on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never see anything except when you
want to,&#8221; complained Mrs. Harrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It saves a deal of trouble. I don&#8217;t want
to go to the colonel&#8217;s this afternoon. He always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
has some frump to pour tea and ask fool
questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The frump, as you call her, is usually a
countess or a duchess,&#8221; with asperity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiddlesticks! Nobility makes a specialty
of frumps; it is one of the species of the caste.
That&#8217;s why I shall never marry a title. I wish
neither to visit nor to entertain frumps.
Frump,&mdash;the word calls up the exact picture;
frump and fatuity. Oh, I&#8217;ll go, but I&#8217;d rather
stay on my balcony and read a good book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; patiently, &#8220;the colonel is one
of the social laws on Como. His sister is the
wife of an earl. You must not offend him.
His Sundays are the most exclusive on the
lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The word exclusive should be properly applied
to those in jail. The social ladder, the
social ladder! Don&#8217;t you know, mother mine,
that every rung is sawn by envy and greed,
and that those who climb highest fall farthest?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are quoting the padre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The padre could give lessons in kindness
and shrewdness to any other man I know. If
he hadn&#8217;t chosen the gown he would have been
a poet. I love the padre, with his snow-white
hair and his withered leathery face. He was
with the old king all through the freeing of
Italy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And had a fine time explaining to the Vatican,&#8221;
sniffed the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day I am going to confess to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confess what?&#8221; asked Celeste.</p>
<p>&#8220;That I have wished the Calabrian&#8217;s voice
would fail her some night in <i>Carmen</i>; that
I am wearing shoes a size too small for me;
that I should like to be rich without labor; that
I am sometimes ashamed of my calling; that I
should have liked to see father win a prizefight;
oh, and a thousand other horrid, hateful
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to gracious that you would fall
violently in love.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Spiteful! There are those lovely lace collars;
come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are hopeless,&#8221; was the mother&#8217;s conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some things, yes,&#8221; gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; said Celeste, who was a privileged
person in the Harrigan family, &#8220;some
day I am going to teach you two how to play
at foils. It would be splendid. And then you
could always settle your differences with
bouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than that,&#8221; retorted Nora. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
ask father to lend us his old set of gloves. He
carries them around as if they were a fetish.
I believe they&#8217;re in the bottom of one of my
steamer trunks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora!&#8221; Mrs. Harrigan was not pleased
with this jest. Any reference to the past was
distasteful to her ears. She, too, went regularly
to confession, but up to the present time
had omitted the sin of being ashamed of her
former poverty and environment. She had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
taken it for granted that upon her shoulders
rested the future good fortune of the Harrigans.
They had money; all that was required
was social recognition. She found it a battle
within a battle. The good-natured reluctance
of her husband and the careless indifference of
her daughter were as hard to combat as the
icy aloofness of those stars into whose orbit
she was pluckily striving to steer the family
bark. It never entered her scheming head that
the reluctance of the father and the indifference
of the daughter were the very conditions
that drew society nearward, for the simple
novelty of finding two persons who did not
care in the least whether they were recognized
or not.</p>
<p>The trio invaded the lace shop, and Nora
and her mother agreed to bury the war-hatchet
in their mutual love of Venetian and
Florentine fineries. Celeste pretended to be
interested, but in truth she was endeavoring
to piece together the few facts she had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
able to extract from the rubbish of conjecture.
Courtlandt and Nora had met somewhere before
the beginning of her own intimacy with
the singer. They certainly must have formed
an extraordinary friendship, for Nora&#8217;s subsequent
vindictiveness could not possibly have
arisen out of the ruins of an indifferent acquaintance.
Nora could not be moved from
the belief that Courtlandt had abducted her;
but Celeste was now positive that he had had
nothing to do with it. He did not impress
her as a man who would abduct a woman, hold
her prisoner for five days, and then liberate
her without coming near her to press his vantage,
rightly or wrongly. He was too strong
a personage. He was here in Bellaggio, and
attached to that could be but one significance.</p>
<p>Why, then, had he not spoken at the photographer&#8217;s?
Perhaps she herself had been
sufficient reason for his dumbness. He had
recognized her, and the espionage of the night
in Paris was no longer a mystery. Nora had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
sent her to follow him; why then all this bitterness,
since she had not been told where he had
gone? Had Nora forgotten to inquire? It
was possible that, in view of the startling
events which had followed, the matter had
slipped entirely from Nora&#8217;s mind. Many a
time she had resorted to that subtle guile
known only of woman to trap the singer. But
Nora never stumbled, and her smile was as
firm a barrier to her thoughts, her secrets, as
a stone wall would have been.</p>
<p>Celeste had known about Herr Rosen&#8217;s infatuation.
Aside from that which concerned
this stranger, Nora had withheld no real secret
from her. Herr Rosen had been given his
congé, but that did not prevent him from sending
fabulous baskets of flowers and gems, all
of which were calmly returned without comment.
Whenever a jewel found its way into
a bouquet of flowers from an unknown, Nora
would promptly convert it into money and give
the proceeds to some charity. It afforded the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
singer no small amusement to show her scorn
in this fashion. Yes, there was one other
little mystery which she did not confide to her
friends. Once a month, wherever she chanced
to be singing, there arrived a simple bouquet
of marguerites, in the heart of which they
would invariably find an uncut emerald.
Nora never disposed of these emeralds. The
flowers she would leave in her dressing-room;
the emerald would disappear. Was there
some one else?</p>
<p>Mrs. Harrigan took the omnibus up to the
villa. It was generally too much of a climb
for her. Nora and Celeste preferred to walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I going to do, Celeste? He is
here, and over at Cadenabbia last night I had
a terrible scene with him. In heaven&#8217;s name,
why can&#8217;t they let me be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Herr Rosen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not speak to your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have a fisticuff which would appear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
in every newspaper in the world? No, thank
you. There is enough scandalous stuff being
printed as it is, and I am helpless to prevent it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the climb starts off stiffly, there wasn&#8217;t
much inclination in either to talk. Celeste had
come to one decision, and that was that Nora
should find out Courtlandt&#8217;s presence here in
Bellaggio herself. When they arrived at the
villa gates, Celeste offered a suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could easily stop all this rumor and
annoyance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, pray, how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer the rumor and annoyance. I
hate men. Most of them are beasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are prejudiced.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Celeste expected Nora to reply that she
had reason, she was disappointed, Nora
quickened her pace, that was all.</p>
<p>At luncheon Harrigan innocently threw a
bomb into camp by inquiring: &#8220;Say, Nora,
who&#8217;s this chump Herr Rosen? He was up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
here last night and again this morning. I was
going to offer him the cot on the balcony, but
I thought I&#8217;d consult you first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Herr Rosen!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Harrigan,
a flutter in her throat. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A charming young man who wishes me to
sign a contract to sing to him in perpetuity,&#8221;
interrupted Nora, pressing her mother&#8217;s foot
warningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you marry him?&#8221; laughed
Harrigan. &#8220;There&#8217;s worse things than frankfurters
and sauerkraut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I can think of just now,&#8221; returned
Nora.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>AT THE CRATER&#8217;S EDGE</h3>
</div>

<p>Harrigan declared that he would not
go over to Caxley-Webster&#8217;s to tea.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve promised for you!&#8221; expostulated
his wife. &#8220;And he admires you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bosh! You women can gad about as
much as you please, but I&#8217;m in wrong when
it comes to eating sponge-cake and knuckling
my knees under a dinky willow table. And
then he always has some frump....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frump!&#8221; repeated Nora, delighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frump inspecting me through a pair of
eye-glasses as if I was a new kind of an animal.
It&#8217;s all right, Molly, when there&#8217;s a big
push. They don&#8217;t notice me much then. But
these six by eight parties have me covering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, dad,&#8221; agreed Nora, who saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
the storm gathering in her mother&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;You can stay home and read the book mother
got you yesterday. Where are you now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Page one,&#8221; grinning.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harrigan wisely refrained from continuing
the debate. James had made up his
mind not to go. If the colonel repeated his
invitation to dinner, where there would be
only the men folk, why, he&#8217;d gladly enough
go to that.</p>
<p>The women departed at three, for there was
to be tennis until five o&#8217;clock. When Harrigan
was reasonably sure that they were half
the distance to the colonel&#8217;s villa, he put on
his hat, whistled to the dachel, and together
they took the path to the village.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d look fine drinking tea, wouldn&#8217;t we,
old scout?&#8221; reaching down and tweaking the
dog&#8217;s velvet ears. &#8220;They don&#8217;t understand,
and it&#8217;s no use trying to make &#8217;em. Nora gets
as near as possible. Herr Rosen! Now,
where have I seen his phiz before? I wish I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
had a real man to talk to. Abbott sulks half
the time, and the Barone can&#8217;t get a joke unless
it&#8217;s driven in with a mallet. On your
way, old scout, or I&#8217;ll step on you. Let&#8217;s see
if we can hoof it down to the village at a trot
without taking the count.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had but two errands to execute. The
first was accomplished expeditely in the little
tobacconist&#8217;s shop under the arcade, where the
purchase of a box of Minghetti cigars promised
later solace. These cigars were cheap,
but Harrigan had a novel way of adding to
their strength if not to their aroma. He possessed
a meerschaum cigar-holder, in which he
had smoked perfectos for some years. The
smoke of an ordinary cigar became that of a
regalia by the time it passed through the nicotine-soaked
clay into the amber mouthpiece.
He had kept secret the result of this trifling
scientific research. It wouldn&#8217;t have been
politic to disclose it to Molly. The second
errand took time and deliberation. He studied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
the long shelves of Tauchnitz. Having
red corpuscles in superabundance, he naturally
preferred them in his literature, in the same
quantity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever read this?&#8221; asked a pleasant voice
from behind, indicating <i>Rodney Stone</i> with
the ferrule of a cane.</p>
<p>Harrigan looked up. &#8220;No. What&#8217;s it
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Best story of the London prize-ring ever
written. You&#8217;re Mr. Harrigan, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; diffidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Edward Courtlandt. If I am
not mistaken, you were a great friend of my
father&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Dick Courtlandt&#8217;s boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, say!&#8221; Harrigan held out his hand
and was gratified to encounter a man&#8217;s grasp.
&#8220;So you&#8217;re Edward Courtlandt? Now, what
do you think of that! Why, your father was
the best sportsman I ever met. Square as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
they make &#8217;em. Not a kink anywhere in his
make-up. He used to come to the bouts in
his plug hat and dress suit; always had a
seat by the ring. I could hear him tap with
his cane when there happened to be a bit of
pretty sparring. He was no slouch himself
when it came to putting on the mitts. Many&#8217;s
the time I&#8217;ve had a round or two with him in
my old gymnasium. Well, well! It&#8217;s good
to see a man again. I&#8217;ve seen your name in
the papers, but I never knew you was Dick&#8217;s
boy. You&#8217;ve got an old grizzly&#8217;s head in your
dining-room at home. Some day I&#8217;ll tell you
how it got there, when you&#8217;re not in a hurry.
I went out to Montana for a scrap, and your
dad went along. After the mill was over, we
went hunting. Come up to the villa and meet
the folks.... Hang it, I forgot.
They&#8217;re up to Caxley-Webster&#8217;s to tea; piffle
water and sticky sponge-cake. I want you to
meet my wife and daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very pleased to meet them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
So this was Nora&#8217;s father? &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
come along with me to the colonel&#8217;s?&#8221; with
sudden inspiration. Here was an opportunity
not to be thrust aside lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I just begged off. They won&#8217;t be
expecting me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the better. I&#8217;d rather have you introduce
me to your family than to have the
colonel. As a matter of fact, I told him I
couldn&#8217;t get up. But I changed my mind.
Come along.&#8221; The first rift in the storm-packed
clouds; and to meet her through the
kindly offices of this amiable man who was her
father!</p>
<p>&#8220;But the pup and the cigar box?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send them up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrigan eyed his own spotless flannels and
compared them with the other&#8217;s. What was
good enough for the son of a millionaire was
certainly good enough for him. Besides, it
would be a bully good joke on Nora and Molly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on!&#8221; he cried. Here was a lark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
He turned the dog and the purchases over to
the proprietor, who promised that they should
arrive instantly at the villa.</p>
<p>Then the two men sought the quay to engage
a boat. They walked shoulder to shoulder,
flat-backed, with supple swinging limbs,
tanned faces and clear animated eyes. Perhaps
Harrigan was ten or fifteen pounds
heavier, but the difference would have been
noticeable only upon the scales.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Padre, my shoe pinches,&#8221; said Nora with a
pucker between her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; replied the padre, &#8220;never
carry your vanity into a shoemaker&#8217;s shop.
The happiest man is he who walks in loose
shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are his own, and not inherited,&#8221;
quickly.</p>
<p>The padre laughed quietly. He was very
fond of this new-found daughter of his. Her
spontaneity, her blooming beauty, her careless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
observation of convention, her independence,
had captivated him. Sometimes he believed
that he thoroughly understood her, when all
at once he would find himself mentally peering
into some dark corner into which the penetrating
light of his usually swift deduction
could throw no glimmer. She possessed the
sins of the butterfly and the latent possibilities
of a Judith. She was the most interesting
feminine problem he had in his long years
encountered. The mother mildly amused him,
for he could discern the character that she
was sedulously striving to batten down beneath
inane social usages and formalities. Some
day she would revert to the original type, and
then he would be glad to renew the acquaintance.
In rather a shamefaced way (a sensation
he could not quite analyze) he loved
the father. The pugilist will always embarrass
the scholar and excite a negligible envy;
for physical perfection is the most envied of
all nature&#8217;s gifts. The padre was short, thickset,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
and inclined toward stoutness in the region
of the middle button of his cassock. But he
was active enough for all purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had many wicked thoughts lately,&#8221;
resumed Nora, turning her gaze away from
the tennis players. She and the padre were
sitting on the lower steps of the veranda. The
others were loitering by the nets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old plaint disturbs you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you not cast it out wholly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate has many tentacles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What produces that condition of mind?&#8221;
meditatively. &#8220;Is it because we have wronged
somebody?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or because somebody has wronged us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or misjudged us, by us have been misjudged?&#8221;
softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; exclaimed Nora, springing
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father is coming up the path!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see him. But I do not recollect
having seen the face of the man with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lithe eagerness went out of Nora&#8217;s
body instantly. Everything seemed to grow
cold, as if she had become enveloped in one
of those fogs that suddenly blow down
menacingly from hidden icebergs. Fortunately
the inquiring eyes of the padre were
not directed at her. He was here, not a
dozen yards away, coming toward her, her
father&#8217;s arm in his! After what had passed
he had dared! It was not often that Nora
Harrigan was subjected to a touch of vertigo,
but at this moment she felt that if she
stirred ever so little she must fall. The stock
whence she had sprung, however, was aggressive
and fearless; and by the time Courtlandt
had reached the outer markings of the courts,
Nora was physically herself again. The advantage
of the meeting would be his. That
was indubitable. Any mistake on her part
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
would be playing into his hands. If only she
had known!</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go and meet them, Padre,&#8221; she
said quietly. With her father, her mother and
the others, the inevitable introduction would
be shorn of its danger. What Celeste might
think was of no great importance; Celeste had
been tried and her loyalty proven. Where
had her father met him, and what diabolical
stroke of fate had made him bring this man
up here?</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora!&#8221; It was her mother calling.</p>
<p>She put her arm through the padre&#8217;s, and
they went forward leisurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, father, I thought you weren&#8217;t coming,&#8221;
said Nora. Her voice was without a
tremor.</p>
<p>The padre hadn&#8217;t the least idea that a volcano
might at any moment open up at his side. He
smiled benignly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Changed my mind,&#8221; said Harrigan.
&#8220;Nora, Molly, I want you to meet Mr. Courtlandt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
I don&#8217;t know that I ever said anything
about it, but his father was one of the best
friends I ever had. He was on his way up
here, so I came along with him.&#8221; Then Harrigan
paused and looked about him embarrassedly.
There were half a dozen unfamiliar
faces.</p>
<p>The colonel quickly stepped into the breach,
and the introduction of Courtlandt became
general. Nora bowed, and became at once engaged
in an animated conversation with the
Barone, who had just finished his set victoriously.</p>
<p>The padre&#8217;s benign smile slowly faded.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>DICK COURTLANDT&#8217;S BOY</h3>
</div>

<p>Presently the servants brought out
the tea-service. The silent dark-skinned
Sikh, with his fierce curling whiskers, his
flashing eyes, the semi-military, semi-oriental
garb, topped by an enormous brown turban,
claimed Courtlandt&#8217;s attention; and it may be
added that he was glad to have something
to look at unembarrassedly. He wanted to
catch the Indian&#8217;s eye, but Rao had no glances
to waste; he was concerned with the immediate
business of superintending the service.</p>
<p>Courtlandt had never been a man to surrender
to impulse. It had been his habit to
form a purpose and then to go about the fulfilling
of it. During the last four or five
months, however, he had swung about like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
weather-cock in April, the victim of a thousand
and one impulses. That morning he
would have laughed had any one prophesied
his presence here. He had fought against the
inclination strongly enough at first, but as
hour after hour went by his resolution weakened.
His meeting Harrigan had been a
stroke of luck. Still, he would have come
anyhow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I am very fond of Como,&#8221; he
found himself replying mechanically to Mrs.
Harrigan. He gave up Rao as hopeless so
far as coming to his rescue was concerned.
He began, despite his repugnance, to watch
Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always a little cold in the higher
Alps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very fond of climbing myself.&#8221;
Nora was laughing and jesting with one of
the English tennis players. Not for nothing
had she been called a great actress, he thought.
It was not humanly possible that her heart was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
under better control than his own; and yet his
was pounding against his ribs in a manner extremely
disquieting. Never must he be left
alone with her; always must it be under circumstances
like this, with people about, and
the more closely about the better. A game
like this was far more exciting than tiger-hunting.
It was going to assume the characteristics
of a duel in which he, being the
more advantageously placed, would succeed
eventually in wearing down her guard. Hereafter,
wherever she went, there must he also
go: St. Petersburg or New York or London.
And by and by the reporters would hear of
it, and there would be rumors which he would
neither deny nor affirm. Sport! He smiled,
and the blood seemed to recede from his throat
and his heart-beats to grow normal.</p>
<p>And all the while Mrs. Harrigan was talking
and he was replying; and she thought him
charming, whereas he had not formed any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
opinion of her at all, nor later could remember
a word of the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tea!&#8221; bawled the colonel. The verb had
its distinct uses, and one generally applied it
to the colonel&#8217;s outbursts without being depressed
by the feeling of inelegance.</p>
<p>There is invariably some slight hesitation in
the selection of chairs around a tea-table in
the open. Nora scored the first point of this
singular battle by seizing the padre on one
side and her father on the other and pulling
them down on the bench. It was adroit in
two ways: it put Courtlandt at a safe distance
and in nowise offended the younger men, who
could find no cause for alarm in the close
proximity of her two fathers, the spiritual and
the physical. A few moments later Courtlandt
saw a smile of malice part her lips, for
he found himself between Celeste and the inevitable
frump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Touched!&#8221; he murmured, for he was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
thorough sportsman and appreciated a good
point even when taken by his opponent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw anything like it,&#8221; whispered
Mrs. Harrigan into the colonel&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw what?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Courtlandt can&#8217;t keep his eyes off of
Nora.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say!&#8221; The colonel adjusted his eye-glass,
not that he expected to see more clearly
by doing so, but because habit had long since
turned an affectation into a movement wholly
mechanical. &#8220;Well, who can blame him?
Gad! if I were only twenty-five or thereabouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harrigan did not encourage this regret.
The colonel had never been a rich man.
On the other hand, this Edward Courtlandt
was very rich; he was young; and he had the
entrée to the best families in Europe, which
was greater in her eyes than either youth or
riches. Between sips of tea she builded a
fine castle in Spain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>Abbott and the Barone carried their cups
and cakes over to the bench and sat down on
the grass, Turkish-wise. Both simultaneously
offered their cakes, and Nora took a ladyfinger
from each. Abbott laughed and the
Barone smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, daddy mine!&#8221; sighed Nora drolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let mother see those shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with &#8217;em? Everybody&#8217;s
wearing the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But I don&#8217;t see how you manage to
do it. One shoe-string is virgin white and
the other is pagan brown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got nine pairs of shoes, and yet there&#8217;s
always something the matter,&#8221; ruefully. &#8220;I
never noticed when I put them on. Besides,
I wasn&#8217;t coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no defense. But rest easy. I&#8217;ll be
as secret as the grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I for one would never have noticed
if you hadn&#8217;t called my attention,&#8221; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
padre, stealing a glance at his own immaculate
patent-leathers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Padre, that wife of mine has eyes
like a pilot-fish. I&#8217;m in for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Borrow one from the colonel before you
go home,&#8221; suggested Abbott.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not half bad,&#8221; gratefully.</p>
<p>Harrigan began to recount the trials of
forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Slyly from the corner of her eye Nora
looked at Courtlandt, who was at that moment
staring thoughtfully into his tea-cup and stirring
the contents industriously. His face
was a little thinner, but aside from that he had
changed scarcely at all; and then, because these
two years had left so little mark upon his
face, a tinge of unreasonable anger ran over
her. &#8220;Men have died and worms have eaten
them,&#8221; she thought cynically. Perhaps the
air between them was sufficiently charged with
electricity to convey the impression across the
intervening space; for his eyes came up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
quickly, but not quickly enough to catch her.
She dropped her glance to Abbott, transferred
it to the Barone, and finally let it rest on her
father&#8217;s face. Four handsomer men she had
never seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never told me you knew Courtlandt,&#8221;
said Harrigan, speaking to Abbott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just happened that way. We went to
school together. When I was little they used
to make me wear curls and wide collars.
Many&#8217;s the time Courtlandt walloped the
school bullies for mussing me up. I don&#8217;t
see him much these days. Once in a while he
walks in. That&#8217;s all. Always seems to know
where his friends are, but none ever knows
where he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abbott proceeded to elaborate some of his
friend&#8217;s exploits. Nora heard, as if from
afar. Vaguely she caught a glimmer of what
the contest was going to be. She could see
only a little way; still, she was optimistically
confident of the result. She was ready. Indeed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
now that the shock of the meeting was
past, she found herself not at all averse to a
conflict. It would be something to let go the
pent-up wrath of two years. Never would
she speak to him directly; never would she permit
him to be alone with her; never would
she miss a chance to twist his heart, to
humiliate him, to snub him. From her point
of view, whatever game he chose to play would
be a losing one. She was genuinely surprised
to learn how eager she was for the game to
begin so that she might gage his strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have heard,&#8221; she was dimly conscious
of saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know you knew,&#8221; said Abbott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knew what?&#8221; rousing herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Courtlandt nearly lost his life in the
eighties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the eighties!&#8221; dismayed at her slip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Latitudes. Polar expedition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens! I was miles away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The padre took her hand in his own and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
began to pat it softly. It was the nearest he
dared approach in the way of suggesting caution.
He alone of them all knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I believe I read something about it in
the newspapers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five years ago.&#8221; Abbott set down his
tea-cup. &#8220;He&#8217;s the bravest man I know.
He&#8217;s rather a friendless man, besides. Horror
of money. Thinks every one is after him
for that. Tries to throw it away; but the income
piles up too quickly. See that Indian,
passing the cakes? Wouldn&#8217;t think it, would
you, that Courtlandt carried him on his back
for five miles! The Indian had fallen afoul
a wounded tiger, and the beaters were
miles off. I&#8217;ve been watching. They haven&#8217;t
even spoken to each other. Courtlandt&#8217;s
probably forgotten all about the incident, and
the Indian would die rather than embarrass
his savior before strangers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend, then, is quite a hero?&#8221;</p>
<p>What was the matter with Nora&#8217;s voice?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
Abbott looked at her wonderingly. The tone
was hard and unmusical.</p>
<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t be anything else, being Dick
Courtlandt&#8217;s boy,&#8221; volunteered Harrigan, with
enthusiasm. &#8220;It runs in the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems strange,&#8221; observed Nora, &#8220;that
I never heard you mention that you knew a
Mr. Courtlandt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Nora, there&#8217;s a lot of things nobody
mentions unless chance brings them up.
Courtlandt&mdash;the one I knew&mdash;has been dead
these sixteen years. If I knew he had had
a son, I&#8217;d forgotten all about it. The only
graveyard isn&#8217;t on the hillside; there&#8217;s one
under everybody&#8217;s thatch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The padre nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>Nora was not particularly pleased with this
phase in the play. Courtlandt would find a
valiant champion in her father, who would
blunder in when some fine passes were being
exchanged. And she could not tell him; she
would have cut out her tongue rather. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
was true that she held the principal cards in
the game, but she could not table them and
claim the tricks as in bridge. She must
patiently wait for him to lead, and he, as she
very well knew, would lead a card at a time,
and then only after mature deliberation.
From the exhilaration which attended the
prospect of battle she passed into a state of
depression, which lasted the rest of the afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you forgive me?&#8221; asked Celeste of
Courtlandt. Never had she felt more ill at
ease. For a full ten minutes he chatted pleasantly,
with never the slightest hint regarding
the episode in Paris. She could stand it no
longer. &#8220;Will you forgive me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That night in Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not permit that to bother you in the
least. I was never going to recall it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it so unpleasant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I was much amused.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did not tell you the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have found out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe that it was you,&#8221; impulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. I had nothing to do with Miss
Harrigan&#8217;s imprisonment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel that you could make a confidant
of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;My dear Miss Fournier, I
have come to the place where I distrust even
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive my curiosity!&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt held out his cup to Rao. &#8220;I am
glad to see you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Sahib!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little Frenchwoman was torn with
curiosity and repression. She wanted to know
what causes had produced this unusual drama
which was unfolding before her eyes. To be
presented with effects which had no apparent
causes was maddening. It was not dissimilar
to being taken to the second act of a modern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
problem play and being forced to leave before
the curtain rose upon the third act. She had
laid all the traps her intelligent mind could invent;
and Nora had calmly walked over them
or around. Nora&#8217;s mind was Celtic: French
in its adroitness and Irish in its watchfulness
and tenacity. And now she had set her arts
of persuasion in motion (aided by a piquant
beauty) to lift a corner of the veil from this
man&#8217;s heart. Checkmate!</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to help you,&#8221; she said, truthfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was useless, but she continued: &#8220;She
does not know that you went to Flora Desimone&#8217;s
that night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet she sent you to watch me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But so many things happened afterward
that she evidently forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was asleep when the pistol went off.
Oh, you must believe that it was purely accidental!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
She was in a terrible state until
morning. What if she had killed you, what if
she had killed you! She seemed to hark upon
that phrase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt turned a sober face toward her.
She might be sincere, and then again she
might be playing the first game over again, in
a different guise. &#8220;It would have been embarrassing
if the bullet had found its mark.&#8221;
He met her eyes squarely, and she saw that
his were totally free from surprise or agitation
or interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you play chess?&#8221; she asked, divertingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chess? I am very fond of that game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I should judge,&#8221; dryly. &#8220;I suppose
you look upon me as a meddler. Perhaps I
am; but I have nothing but good will toward
you; and Nora would be very angry if she
knew that I was discussing her affairs with
you. But I love her and want to make her
happy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That seems to be the ambition of all the
young men, at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jealousy? But the smile baffled her.
&#8220;Will you be here long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon Nora?&#8221; persistently.</p>
<p>&#8220;The weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are hopeless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; on the contrary, I am the most
optimistic man in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked into this reply very carefully.
If he had hopes of winning Nora Harrigan,
optimistic he certainly must be. Perhaps it
was not optimism. Rather might it not be a
purpose made of steel, bendable but not breakable,
reinforced by a knowledge of conditions
which she would have given worlds to learn?</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she not beautiful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a poet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; her eyes widening. &#8220;I
believe you know who did commit that outrage.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>For the first time he frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; I promise not to ask any more
questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be very agreeable to me.&#8221;
Then, as if he realized the rudeness of his reply,
he added: &#8220;Before I leave I will tell
you all you wish to know, upon one condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will say nothing to any one, you will
question neither Miss Harrigan nor myself,
nor permit yourself to be questioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, will you not take me over to
your friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there?&#8221; aghast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. We can sit upon the grass.
They seem to be having a good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a man! Take him over, into the
enemy&#8217;s camp? Nothing would be more
agreeable to her. Who would be the stronger,
Nora or this provoking man?</p>
<p>So they crossed over and joined the group.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
The padre smiled. It was a situation such as
he loved to study: a strong man and a strong
woman, at war. But nothing happened; not
a ripple anywhere to disclose the agitation beneath.
The man laughed and the woman
laughed, but they spoke not to each other, nor
looked once into each other&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>The sun was dropping toward the western
tops. The guests were leaving by twos and
threes. The colonel had prevailed upon his
dinner-guests not to bother about going back
to the village to dress, but to dine in the
clothes they wore. Finally, none remained
but Harrigan, Abbott, the Barone, the padre
and Courtlandt. And they talked noisily and
agreeably concerning man-affairs until Rao
gravely announced that dinner was served.</p>
<p>It was only then, during the lull which followed,
that light was shed upon the puzzle
which had been subconsciously stirring Harrigan&#8217;s
mind: Nora had not once spoken to
the son of his old friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>EVERYTHING BUT THE TRUTH</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why the colonel didn&#8217;t invite
some of the ladies,&#8221; Mrs. Harrigan
complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a man-party. He&#8217;s giving it to please
himself. And I do not blame him. The
women about here treat him abominably.
They come at all times of the day and night,
use his card-room, order his servants about,
drink his whisky and smoke his cigarettes, and
generally invite themselves to luncheon and tea
and dinner. And then, when they are ready
to go back to their villas or hotel, take his
motor-boat without a thank-you. The colonel
has about three thousand pounds outside his
half-pay, and they are all crazy to marry him
because his sister is a countess. As a bachelor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
he can live like a prince, but as a married man
he would have to dig. He told me that if
he had been born Adam, he&#8217;d have climbed
over Eden&#8217;s walls long before the Angel of the
Flaming Sword paddled him out. Says he&#8217;s
always going to be a bachelor, unless I take
pity on him,&#8221; mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he...?&#8221; in horrified tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;About three times a visit,&#8221; Nora admitted;
&#8220;but I told him that I&#8217;d be a daughter,
a cousin, or a niece to him, or even a grandchild.
The latter presented too many complications,
so we compromised on niece.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew when you were serious and
when you were fooling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am often as serious when I am fooling
as I am foolish when I am serious....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora, you will have me shrieking in a
minute!&#8221; despaired the mother. &#8220;Did the
colonel really propose to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only in fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Celeste laughed and threw her arm around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
the mother&#8217;s waist, less ample than substantial.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you care! Nora is being pursued by
little devils and is venting her spite on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be too much Burgundy and tobacco,
to say nothing of the awful stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the good old padre there? Hardly,&#8221;
said Nora.</p>
<p>Celeste was a French woman. &#8220;I confess
that I like a good story that isn&#8217;t vulgar. And
none of them look like men who would stoop
to vulgarity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about all you know of men,&#8221; declared
Mrs. Harrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am willing to give them the benefit of
a doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Celeste,&#8221; cried Nora, gaily, &#8220;I&#8217;ve an idea.
Supposing you and I run back after dinner and
hide in the card-room, which is right across
from the dining-room? Then we can judge
for ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora Harrigan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Molly Harrigan!&#8221; mimicked the incorrigible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
&#8220;Mother mine, you must learn to
recognize a jest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; cried Celeste.</p>
<p>As if to put a final period to the discussion,
Nora began to hum audibly an aria from
<i>Aïda</i>.</p>
<p>They engaged a carriage in the village and
were driven up to the villa. On the way Mrs.
Harrigan discussed the stranger, Edward
Courtlandt. What a fine-looking young man
he was, and how adventurous, how well-connected,
how enormously rich, and what an
excellent catch! She and Celeste&mdash;the one
innocently and the other provocatively&mdash;continued
the subject to the very doors of the
villa. All the while Nora hummed softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of him, Nora?&#8221; the
mother inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This Mr. Courtlandt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to him,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
carelessly. But once alone with Celeste, she
seized her by the arm, a little roughly.
&#8220;Celeste, I love you better than any outsider
I know. But if you ever discuss that man in
my presence again, I shall cease to regard you
even as an acquaintance. He has come here
for the purpose of annoying me, though he
promised the prefect in Paris never to annoy
me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The prefect!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The morning I left Versailles I met
him in the private office of the prefect. He
had powerful friends who aided him in establishing
an alibi. I was only a woman, so
I didn&#8217;t count.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora, if I have meddled in any way,&#8221;
proudly, &#8220;it has been because I love you, and
I see you unhappy. You have nearly killed
me with your sphinx-like actions. You have
never asked me the result of my spying for
you that night. Spying is not one of my usual
vocations, but I did it gladly for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You gave him my address?&#8221; coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not. I convinced him that I had
come at the behest of Flora Desimone. He
demanded her address, which I gave him. If
ever there was a man in a fine rage, it was he
as he left me to go there. If he found out
where we lived, the Calabrian assisted him,
I spoke to him rather plainly at tea. He said
that he had had nothing whatever to do with
the abduction, and I believe him. I am positive
that he is not the kind of man to go that
far and not proceed to the end. And now,
will you please tell Carlos to bring my dinner to
my room?&#8221;</p>
<p>The impulsive Irish heart was not to be resisted.
Nora wanted to remain firm, but instead
she swept Celeste into her arms.
&#8220;Celeste, don&#8217;t be angry! I am very, very
unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Irish heart was impulsive, the French
one was no less so. Celeste wanted to cry out
that she was unhappy, too.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother to dress! Just give your
hair a pat or two. We&#8217;ll all three dine on the
balcony.&#8221;</p>
<p>Celeste flew to her room. Nora went over
to the casement window and stared at the
darkening mountains. When she turned
toward the dresser she was astonished to find
two bouquets. One was an enormous bunch
of violets. The other was of simple marguerites.
She picked up the violets. There
was a card without a name; but the phrase
scribbled across the face of it was sufficient.
She flung the violets far down into the grape-vines
below. The action was without anger,
excited rather by a contemptuous indifference.
As for the simple marguerites, she took them
up gingerly. The arc these described through
the air was even greater than that performed
by the violets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a silly fool, I suppose,&#8221; she murmured,
turning back into the room again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>It was ten o&#8217;clock when the colonel bade
his guests good night as they tumbled out of
his motor-boat. They were in more or less
exuberant spirits; for the colonel knew how
to do two things particularly well: order a
dinner, and avoid the many traps set for him
by scheming mamas and eligible widows. Abbott,
the Barone and Harrigan, arm in arm,
marched on ahead, whistling one tune in three
different keys, while Courtlandt set the pace
for the padre.</p>
<p>All through the dinner the padre had
watched and listened. Faces were generally
books to him, and he read in this young man&#8217;s
face many things that pleased him. This
was no night rover, a fool over wine and
women, a spendthrift. He straightened out
the lines and angles in a man&#8217;s face as a
skilled mathematician elucidates an intricate
geometrical problem. He had arrived at the
basic knowledge that men who live mostly out
of doors are not volatile and irresponsible, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
are more inclined to reserve, to reticence, to
a philosophy which is broad and comprehensive
and generous. They are generally
men who are accomplishing things, and who
let other people tell about it. Thus, the padre
liked Courtlandt&#8217;s voice, his engaging smile,
his frank unwavering eyes; and he liked the
leanness about the jaws, which was indicative
of strength of character. In fact, he experienced
a singular jubilation as he walked
beside this silent man.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a grave mistake somewhere,&#8221;
he mused aloud, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Courtlandt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg yours. I was thinking aloud. How
long have you known the Harrigans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The father and mother I never saw before
to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have met Miss Harrigan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen her on the stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the happiness of being her confessor.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>They proceeded quite as far as a hundred
yards before Courtlandt volunteered: &#8220;That
must be interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a good Catholic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; I recollect now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I haven&#8217;t any religion such as requires
my presence in churches. Don&#8217;t misunderstand
me! As a boy I was bred in the
Episcopal Church; but I have traveled so
much that I have drifted out of the circle. I
find that when I am out in the open, in the
heart of some great waste, such as a desert,
a sea, the top of a mountain, I can see the
greatness of the Omnipotent far more clearly
and humbly than within the walls of a
cathedral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But God imposes obligations upon mankind.
We have ceased to look upon the hermit
as a holy man, but rather as one devoid of
courage. It is not the stone and the stained
windows; it is the text of our daily work, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
the physical being of the Church represents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not avoided any of my obligations.&#8221;
Courtlandt shifted his stick behind
his back. &#8220;I was speaking of the church and
the open field, as they impressed me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You believe in the tenets of Christianity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely! A man must pin his faith and
hope to something more stable than humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to convert you to my way of
thinking,&#8221; simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is impossible. Who knows?&#8221;</p>
<p>The padre, as they continued onward,
offered many openings, but the young man at
his side refused to be drawn into any confidence.
So the padre gave up, for the futility
of his efforts became irksome. His own lips
were sealed, so he could not ask point-blank
the question that clamored at the tip of his
tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are Miss Harrigan&#8217;s confessor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it strike you strangely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Merely the coincidence.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I were not her confessor I should take
the liberty of asking you some questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite possible that I should decline
to answer them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The padre shrugged. &#8220;It is patent to me
that you will go about this affair in your own
way. I wish you well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. As Miss Harrigan&#8217;s confessor
you doubtless know everything but the
truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The padre laughed this time. The shops
were closed. The open restaurants by the
water-front held but few idlers. The padre
admired the young man&#8217;s independence.
Most men would have hesitated not a second
to pour the tale into his ears in hope of material
assistance. The padre&#8217;s admiration was
equally proportioned with respect.</p>
<p>&#8220;I leave you here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You will
see me frequently at the villa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly shall be there frequently.
Good night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>Courtlandt quickened his pace which soon
brought him alongside the others. They
stopped in front of Abbott&#8217;s pension, and he
tried to persuade them to come up for a nightcap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to it, my boy,&#8221; said Harrigan.
&#8220;I need no nightcap on top of cognac forty-eight
years old. For me that&#8217;s a whole suit
of pajamas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You come, Ted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abbey, I wouldn&#8217;t climb those stairs for
a bottle of Horace&#8217;s Falernian, served on
Seneca&#8217;s famous citron table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a friend in the world,&#8221; Abbott
lamented.</p>
<p>Laughingly they hustled him into the hallway
and fled. Then Courtlandt went his way
alone. He slept with the dubious satisfaction
that the first day had not gone badly. The
wedge had been entered. It remained to be
seen if it could be dislodged.</p>
<p>Harrigan was in a happy temper. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
kissed his wife and chucked Nora under the
chin. And then Mrs. Harrigan launched the
thunderbolt which, having been held on
the leash for several hours, had, for all of
that, lost none of its ability to blight and
scorch.</p>
<p>&#8220;James, you are about as hopeless a man
as ever was born. You all but disgraced us
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; cried the bewildered Harrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at those tennis shoes; one white
string and one brown one. It&#8217;s enough to
drive a woman mad. What in heaven&#8217;s name
made you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the after effect of a good
dinner, that dwindling away of pleasant
emotions; perhaps it was the very triviality
of the offense for which he was thus suddenly
arraigned; at any rate, he lost his temper, and
he was rather formidable when that occurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it, Molly, I wasn&#8217;t going, but Courtlandt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
asked me to go with him, and I never
thought of my shoes. You are always finding
fault with me these days. I don&#8217;t drink,
I don&#8217;t gamble, I don&#8217;t run around after other
women; I never did. But since you&#8217;ve got
this social bug in your bonnet, you keep me
on hooks all the while. Nobody noticed the
shoe-strings; and they would have looked upon
it as a joke if they had. After all, I&#8217;m the
boss of this ranch. If I want to wear a white
string and a black one, I&#8217;ll do it. Here!&#8221;
He caught up the book on social usages and
threw it out of the window. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever
shove a thing like that under my nose again.
If you do, I&#8217;ll hike back to little old New
York and start the gym again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rammed one of the colonel&#8217;s perfectos
(which he had been saving for the morrow)
between his teeth, and stalked into the
garden.</p>
<p>Nora was heartless enough to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t talked like that to me in years!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
Mrs. Harrigan did not know what to do,&mdash;follow
him or weep. She took the middle course,
and went to bed.</p>
<p>Nora turned out the lights and sat out on
the little balcony. The moonshine was glorious.
So dense was the earth-blackness that
the few lights twinkling here and there were
more like fallen stars. Presently she heard a
sound. It was her father, returning as silently
as he could. She heard him fumble among
the knickknacks on the mantel, and then go
away again. By and by she saw a spot of
white light move hither and thither among the
grape arbors. For five or six minutes she
watched it dance. Suddenly all became dark
again. She laid her head upon the railing
and conned over the day&#8217;s events. These
were not at all satisfactory to her. Then her
thoughts traveled many miles away. Six
months of happiness, of romance, of play, and
then misery and blackness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora, are you there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Over here on the balcony. What
were you doing down there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nora, I&#8217;m sorry I lost my temper.
But Molly&#8217;s begun to nag me lately, and I
can&#8217;t stand it. I went after that book. Did
you throw some flowers out of the window?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bunch of daisies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marguerites,&#8221; she corrected.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same to me. I picked up the
bunch, and look at what I found inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>He extended his palm, flooding it with the
light of his pocket-lamp. Nora&#8217;s heart tightened.
What she saw was a beautiful uncut
emerald.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A COMEDY WITH MUSIC</h3>
</div>

<p>The Harrigans occupied the suite in the
east wing of the villa. This consisted
of a large drawing-room and two ample bedchambers,
with window-balconies and a private
veranda in the rear, looking off toward
the green of the pines and the metal-like
luster of the copper beeches. Always the suite
was referred to by the management as having
once been tenanted by the empress of Germany.
Indeed, tourists were generally and
respectively and impressively shown the suite
(provided it was not at the moment inhabited),
and were permitted to peer eagerly about for
some sign of the vanished august presence.
But royalty in passing, as with the most
humble of us, leaves nothing behind save the
memory of a tip, generous or otherwise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>It was raining, a fine, soft, blurring Alpine
rain, and a blue-grey monotone prevailed upon
the face of the waters and defied all save the
keenest scrutiny to discern where the mountain
tops ended and the sky began. It was a
day for indoors, for dreams, good books, and
good fellows.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned photographer would have
admired and striven to perpetuate the group
in the drawing-room. In the old days it was
quite the proper thing to snap the family group
while they were engaged in some pleasant
pastime, such as spinning, or painting china,
or playing the piano, or reading a volume of
poems. No one ever seemed to bother about
the incongruence of the eyes, which were invariably
focused at the camera lens. Here
they all were. Mrs. Harrigan was deep in
the intricate maze of the Amelia Ars of
Bologna, which, as the initiated know, is a
wonderful lace. By one of the windows sat
Nora, winding interminable yards of lace-hemming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
from off the willing if aching digits
of the Barone, who was speculating as to
what his Neapolitan club friends would say
could they see, by some trick of crystal-gazing,
his present occupation. Celeste was at the
piano, playing (<i>pianissimo</i>) snatches from
the operas, while Abbott looked on, his elbows
propped upon his knees, his chin in his
palms, and a quality of ecstatic content in
his eyes. He was in his working clothes,
picturesque if paint-daubed. The morning
had been pleasant enough, but just before
luncheon the rain clouds had gathered and
settled down with that suddenness known only
in high altitudes.</p>
<p>The ex-gladiator sat on one of those slender
mockeries, composed of gold-leaf and parabolic
curves and faded brocade, such as one
sees at the Trianon or upon the stage or in
the new home of a new millionaire, and which,
if the true facts be known, the ingenious Louis
invented for the discomfort of his favorites
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
and the folly of future collectors. It creaked
whenever Harrigan sighed, which was often,
for he was deeply immersed (and no better
word could be selected to fit his mental condition)
in the baneful book which he had hurled
out of the window the night before, only to retrieve
like the good dog that he was. To-day
his shoes offered no loophole to criticism; he
had very well attended to that. His tie harmonized
with his shirt and stockings; his suit
was of grey tweed; in fact, he was the glass
of fashion and the mold of form, at least for
the present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Molly, I don&#8217;t see what difference it
makes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Difference what makes, James?&#8221; Mrs.
Harrigan raised her eyes from her work.
James had been so well-behaved that morning
it was only logical for her to anticipate that
he was about to abolish at one fell stroke all
his hard-earned merits.</p>
<p>&#8220;About eating salads. We never used to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
put oil on our tomatoes. Sugar and vinegar
were good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sugar and vinegar are not nourishing;
olive-oil is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We seemed to hike along all right before
we learned that.&#8221; His guardian angel was
alert this time, and he returned to his delving
without further comment. By and by he got
up. &#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; He dropped the wearisome
volume on the reading-table, took up a paper-covered
novel, and turned to the last fight of
the blacksmith in <i>Rodney Stone</i>. Here was
something that made the invention of type
excusable, even commendable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Play the fourth <i>ballade</i>,&#8221; urged Abbott.</p>
<p>Celeste was really a great artist. As an interpreter
of Chopin she had no rival among
women, and only one man was her equal.
She had fire, tenderness, passion, strength; she
had beyond all these, soul, which is worth more
in true expression than the most marvelous
technique. She had chosen Chopin for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
brilliance, as some will chose Turner in preference
to Corot: riots of color, barbaric and
tingling. She was as great a genius in her
way as Nora was in hers. There was something
of the elfin child in her spirit. Whenever
she played to Abbott, there was a quality
in the expression that awakened a wonderment
in Nora&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>As Celeste began the <i>andante</i>, Nora signified
to the Barone to drop his work. She
let her own hands fall. Harrigan gently
closed his book, for in that rough kindly soul
of his lay a mighty love of music. He himself
was without expression of any sort, and
somehow music seemed to stir the dim and not
quite understandable longing for utterance.
Mrs. Harrigan alone went on with her work;
she could work and listen at the same time.
After the magnificent finale, nothing in the
room stirred but her needle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; cried the Barone, breaking the
spell.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You never played that better,&#8221; declared
Nora.</p>
<p>Celeste, to escape the keen inquiry of her
friend and to cover up her embarrassment,
dashed into one of the lighter compositions, a
waltz. It was a favorite of Nora&#8217;s. She rose
and went over to the piano and rested a hand
upon Celeste&#8217;s shoulder. And presently her
voice took up the melody. Mrs. Harrigan
dropped her needle. It was not that she was
particularly fond of music, but there was
something in Nora&#8217;s singing that cast a temporary
spell of enchantment over her, rendering
her speechless and motionless. She was
not of an analytical turn of mind; thus, the
truth escaped her. She was really lost in admiration
of herself: she had produced this
marvelous being!</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some!&#8221; Harrigan beat his hands
together thunderously. &#8220;Great stuff; eh,
Barone?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Barone raised his hands as if to express
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
his utter inability to describe his sensations.
His elation was that ascribed to those fortunate
mortals whom the gods lifted to Olympus.
At his feet lay the lace-hemming, hopelessly
snarled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, father!&#8221; remonstrated Nora;
&#8220;you will wake up all the old ladies who are
having their siesta.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah! I&#8217;ll bet a doughnut their ears are
glued to their doors. What ho! Somebody&#8217;s
at the portcullis. Probably the padre, come
up for tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was at the door instantly. He flung it
open heartily. It was characteristic of the
man to open everything widely, his heart, his
mind, his hate or his affection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, come in! Just in time for the
matinée concert.&#8221;</p>
<p>The padre was not alone. Courtlandt followed
him in.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-256.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 506px; height: 305px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 506px;'>
Courtlandt followed him in.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We have been standing in the corridor for
ten minutes,&#8221; affirmed the padre, sending a
winning smile around the room. &#8220;Mr. Courtlandt
was for going down to the bureau and
sending up our cards. But I would not hear
of such formality. I am a privileged person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure yes! Molly, ring for tea, and tell
&#8217;em to make it hot. How about a little peg,
as the colonel says?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men declined.</p>
<p>How easily and nonchalantly the man stood
there by the door as Harrigan took his hat!
Celeste was aquiver with excitement. She
was thoroughly a woman: she wanted something
to happen, dramatically, romantically.</p>
<p>But her want was a vain one. The man
smiled quizzically at Nora, who acknowledged
the salutation by a curtsy which would have
frightened away the banshees of her childhood.
Nora hated scenes, and Courtlandt had the
advantage of her in his knowledge of this.
Celeste remained at the piano, but Nora turned
as if to move away.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried the padre, his palms extended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
in protest. &#8220;If you stop the music I
shall leave instantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we are all through, Padre,&#8221; replied
Nora, pinching Celeste&#8217;s arm, which action the
latter readily understood as a command to
leave the piano.</p>
<p>Celeste, however, had a perverse streak in
her to-day. Instead of rising as Nora expected
she would, she wheeled on the stool and
began <i>Morning Mood</i> from Peer Gynt, because
the padre preferred Grieg or Beethoven
to Chopin. Nora frowned at the pretty head
below her. She stooped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t forgive you for this trick,&#8221; she
whispered.</p>
<p>Celeste shrugged, and her fingers did not
falter. So Nora moved away this time in
earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you must sing. That is what I came
up for,&#8221; insisted the padre. If there was any
malice in the churchman, it was of a negative
quality. But it was in his Latin blood that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
drama should appeal to him strongly, and here
was an unusual phase in The Great Play. He
had urged Courtlandt, much against the latter&#8217;s
will this day, to come up with him, simply
that he might set a little scene such as this
promised to be and study it from the vantage
of the prompter. He knew that the principal
theme of all great books, of all great
dramas, was antagonism, antagonism between
man and woman, though by a thousand other
names has it been called. He had often said,
in a spirit of raillery, that this antagonism was
principally due to the fact that Eve had been
constructed (and very well) out of a rib from
Adam. Naturally she resented this, that she
had not been fashioned independently, and
would hold it against man until the true secret
of the parable was made clear to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sing that, Padre?&#8221; said Nora. &#8220;Why,
there are no words to it that I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Words? <i>Peste!</i> Who cares for words
no one really ever understands? It is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
voice, my child. Go on, or I shall make you
do some frightful penance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora saw that further opposition would be
useless. After all, it would be better to sing.
She would not be compelled to look at this
man she so despised. For a moment her tones
were not quite clear; but Celeste increased the
volume of sound warningly, and as this required
more force on Nora&#8217;s part, the little
cross-current was passed without mishap. It
was mere pastime for her to follow these wonderful
melodies. She had no words to recall
so that her voice was free to do with as she
elected. There were bars absolutely impossible
to follow, note for note, but she got around
this difficulty by taking the key and holding it
strongly and evenly. In ordinary times Nora
never refused to sing for her guests, if she
happened to be in voice. There was none of
that conceited arrogance behind which most of
the vocal celebrities hide themselves. At the
beginning she had intended to sing badly; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
as the music proceeded, she sang as she had not
sung in weeks. To fill this man&#8217;s soul with a
hunger for the sound of her voice, to pour
into his heart a fresh knowledge of what he
had lost forever and forever!</p>
<p>Courtlandt sat on the divan beside Harrigan
who, with that friendly spirit which he observed
toward all whom he liked, whether of
long or short acquaintance, had thrown his
arm across Courtlandt&#8217;s shoulder. The
younger man understood all that lay behind
the simple gesture, and he was secretly pleased.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Harrigan was not. She was
openly displeased, and in vain she tried to
catch the eye of her wayward lord. A man
he had known but twenty-four hours, and to
greet him with such coarse familiarity!</p>
<p>Celeste was not wholly unmerciful. She
did not finish the suite, but turned from the
keys after the final chords of <i>Morning Mood</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; said Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not stop,&#8221; begged Courtlandt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>Nora looked directly into his eyes as she
replied: &#8220;One&#8217;s voice can not go on forever,
and mine is not at all strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>And thus, without having originally the least
intent to do so, they broke the mutual contract
on which they had separately and secretly
agreed: never to speak directly to each
other. Nora was first to realize what she
had done, and she was furiously angry with
herself. She left the piano.</p>
<p>As if her mind had opened suddenly like a
book, Courtlandt sprang from the divan and
reached for the fat ball of lace-hemming. He
sat down in Nora&#8217;s chair and nodded significantly
to the Barone, who blushed. To hold
the delicate material for Nora&#8217;s unwinding was
a privilege of the gods, but to hold it for this
man for whom he held a dim feeling of antagonism
was altogether a different matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is horribly tangled,&#8221; he admitted, hoping
thus to escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter. You hold the ball. I&#8217;ll untangle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
it. I never saw a fish-line I could not
straighten out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora laughed. It was not possible for her
to repress the sound. Her sense of humor
was too strong in this case to be denied its
release in laughter. It was free of the subtler
emotions; frank merriment, no more, no less.
And possessing the hunter&#8217;s extraordinarily
keen ear, Courtlandt recognized the quality;
and the weight of a thousand worlds lightened
its pressure upon his heart. And the Barone
laughed, too. So there they were, the three
of them. But Nora&#8217;s ineffectual battle for
repression had driven her near to hysteria.
To escape this dire calamity, she flung open a
casement window and stood within it, breathing
in the heavy fragrance of the rain-laden
air.</p>
<p>This little comedy had the effect of relaxing
them all; and the laughter became general.
Abbott&#8217;s smile faded soonest. He stared at
his friend in wonder not wholly free from a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
sense of evil fortune. Never had he known
Courtlandt to aspire to be a squire of dames.
To see the Barone hold the ball as if it were
hot shot was amusing; but the cool imperturbable
manner with which Courtlandt proceeded
to untangle the snarl was disturbing.
Why the deuce wasn&#8217;t he himself big and
strong, silent and purposeful, instead of being
a dawdling fool of an artist?</p>
<p>No answer came to his inquiry, but there
was a knock at the door. The managing
director handed Harrigan a card.</p>
<p>&#8220;Herr Rosen,&#8221; he read aloud. &#8220;Send him
up. Some friend of yours, Nora; Herr
Rosen. I told Mr. Jilli to send him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The padre drew his feet under his cassock,
a sign of perturbation; Courtlandt continued
to unwind; the Barone glanced fiercely at
Nora, who smiled enigmatically.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>HERR ROSEN&#8217;S REGRETS</h3>
</div>

<p>Herr Rosen! There was no outward
reason why the name should have set a
chill on them all, turned them into expectant
statues. Yet, all semblance of good-fellowship
was instantly gone. To Mrs. Harrigan
alone did the name convey a sense of responsibility,
a flutter of apprehension not unmixed
with delight. She put her own work behind
the piano lid, swooped down upon the two men
and snatched away the lace-hemming, to the
infinite relief of the one and the surprise of
the other. Courtlandt would have liked nothing
better than to hold the lace in his lap, for
it was possible that Herr Rosen might wish to
shake hands, however disinclined he might be
within to perform such greeting. The lace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
disappeared. Mrs. Harrigan smoothed out
the wrinkles in her dress. From the others
there had been little movement and no sound
to speak of. Harrigan still waited by the
door, seriously contemplating the bit of pasteboard
in his hand.</p>
<p>Nora did not want to look, but curiosity
drew her eyes imperiously toward Courtlandt.
He had not risen. Did he know? Did he
understand? Was his attitude pretense or innocence?
Ah, if she could but look behind
that impenetrable mask! How she hated him!
The effrontery of it all! And she could do
nothing, say nothing: dared not tell them then
and there what he truly was, a despicable
scoundrel! The son of her father&#8217;s dearest
friend; what mockery! A friend of the family!
It was maddening.</p>
<p>Herr Rosen brushed past Harrigan unceremoniously,
without pausing, and went straight
over to Nora, who was thereupon seized by an
uncontrollable spirit of devilment. She hated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
Herr Rosen, but she was going to be as pleasant
and as engaging as she knew how to be.
She did not care if he misinterpreted her
mood. She welcomed him with a hand. He
went on to Mrs. Harrigan, who colored pleasurably.
He was then introduced, and he acknowledged
each introduction with a careless
nod. He was there to see Nora, and he did
not propose to put himself to any inconvenience
on account of the others.</p>
<p>The temporary restraint which had settled
upon the others at the announcement of Herr
Rosen&#8217;s arrival passed away. Courtlandt,
who had remained seated during the initial
formalities (a fact which bewildered Abbott,
who knew how punctilious his friend was in
matters of this kind) got up and took a third
of the divan.</p>
<p>Harrigan dropped down beside him. It was
his habit to watch his daughter&#8217;s face when
any guest arrived. He formed his impression
on what he believed to be hers. That she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
was a consummate actress never entered into
his calculations. The welcoming smile dissipated
any doubts.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter where we are, they keep coming.
She has as many friends as T. R. I
never bother to keep track of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be rather difficult,&#8221; assented
Courtlandt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to see the flowers. Loads of
&#8217;em. And say, what do you think? Every
jewel that comes she turns into money and
gives to charity. Can you beat it? Fine joke
on the Johnnies. Of course, I mean stones
that turn up anonymously. Those that have
cards go back by fast-mail. It&#8217;s a good thing
I don&#8217;t chance across the senders. Now, boy,
I want you to feel at home here in this family;
I want you to come up when you want to
and at any old time of day. I kind of want
to pay back to you all the kind things your
dad did for me. And I don&#8217;t want any Oh-pshawing.
Get me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever you say. If my dad did you
any favors it was because he liked and admired
you; not with any idea of having you
discharge the debt in the future by way of
inconveniencing yourself on my account. Just
let me be a friend of the family, like Abbott
here. That would be quite enough honor for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on! Say, that blacksmith yarn
was a corker. He was a game old codger.
That was scrapping; no hall full of tobacco-smoke,
no palm-fans, lemonade, peanuts and
pop-corn; just right out on the turf, and may
the best man win. I know. I went through
that. No frame-ups, all square and on the
level. A fellow had to fight those days, no
sparring, no pretty footwork. Sometimes I&#8217;ve
a hankering to get back and exchange a wallop
or two. Nothing to it, though. My wife
won&#8217;t let me, as the song goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt chuckled. &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s the
monotony. A man who has been active hates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
to sit down and twiddle his thumbs. You
exercise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walk a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Climb any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know that game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great sport. I&#8217;ll break you in some
day, if you say. You&#8217;ll like it. The mountains
around here are not dangerous. We can
go up and down in a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go you. But, say, last night Nora
chucked a bunch of daisies out of the window,
and as I was nosing around in the vineyard, I
came across it. You know how a chap will
absently pick a bunch of flowers apart. What
do you think I found?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A note?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This.&#8221; Harrigan exhibited the emerald.
&#8220;Who sent it? Where the dickens did it
come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt took the stone and examined it
carefully. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a bad stone. Uncut
but polished; oriental.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oriental, eh? What would you say it was
worth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, somewhere between six and seven
hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suffering shamrocks! A little green pebble
like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut and flawless, at that size, it would be
worth pounds instead of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of that? Nora
told me to keep it, so I guess I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. If a man sends a thing like
this anonymously, he can&#8217;t possibly complain.
Have it made into a stick pin.&#8221; Courtlandt
returned the stone which Harrigan pocketed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I wish Nora&#8217;d marry and settle
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is young. You wouldn&#8217;t have quit
the game at her age!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not! But that&#8217;s different.
A man&#8217;s business is to fight for his grub,
whether in an office or in the ring. That&#8217;s a
part of the game. But a woman ought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
have a home, live in it three-fourths of the
year, and bring up good citizens. That&#8217;s what
we are all here for. Molly used to stay at
home, but now it&#8217;s the social bug, gadding
from morning until night. Ah, here&#8217;s Carlos
with the tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herr Rosen instantly usurped the chair next
to Nora, who began to pour the tea. He had
come up from the village prepared for a disagreeable
half-hour. Instead of being greeted
with icy glances from stormy eyes, he encountered
such smiles as this adorable creature
had never before bestowed upon him. He
was in the clouds. That night at Cadenabbia
had apparently knocked the bottom out of his
dream. Women were riddles which only they
themselves could solve for others. For this
one woman he was perfectly ready to throw
everything aside. A man lived but once; and
he was a fool who would hold to tinsel in preference
to such happiness as he thought he saw
opening out before him. Nora saw, but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
did not care. That in order to reach another
she was practising infinite cruelty on this
man (whose one fault lay in that he loved her)
did not appeal to her pity. But her arrow
flew wide of the target; at least, there appeared
no result to her archery in malice. Not once
had the intended victim looked over to where
she sat. And yet she knew that he must be
watching; he could not possibly avoid it and
be human. And when he finally came forward
to take his cup, she leaned toward Herr Rosen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You take two lumps?&#8221; she asked sweetly.
It was only a chance shot, but she hit on the
truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you remember?&#8221; excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One lump for mine, please,&#8221; said Courtlandt,
smiling.</p>
<p>She picked up a cube of sugar and dropped
it into his cup. She had the air of one wishing
it were poison. The recipient of this good
will, with perfect understanding, returned to
the divan, where the padre and Harrigan were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
gravely toasting each other with Benedictine.</p>
<p>Nora made no mistake with either Abbott&#8217;s
cup or the Barone&#8217;s; but the two men were
filled with but one desire, to throw Herr Rosen
out of the window. What had begun as a
beautiful day was now becoming black and
uncertain.</p>
<p>The Barone could control every feature
save his eyes, and these openly admitted
deep anger. He recollected Herr Rosen well
enough. The encounter over at Cadenabbia
was not the first by many. Herr Rosen!
His presence in this room under that name
was an insult, and he intended to call the
interloper to account the very first opportunity
he found.</p>
<p>Perhaps Celeste, sitting as quiet as a mouse
upon the piano-stool, was the only one who
saw these strange currents drifting dangerously
about. That her own heart ached miserably
did not prevent her from observing
things with all her usual keenness. Ah, Nora,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
Nora, who have everything to give and yet
give nothing, why do you play so heartless a
game? Why hurt those who can no more help
loving you than the earth can help whirling
around the calm dispassionate sun? Always
they turn to you, while I, who have so much
to give, am given nothing! She set down her
tea-cup and began the aria from <i>La Bohème</i>.</p>
<p>Nora, without relaxing the false smile, suddenly
found emptiness in everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sing!&#8221; said Herr Rosen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am too tired. Some other time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not press her. Instead, he whispered
in his own tongue: &#8220;You are the most
adorable woman in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Nora turned upon him a pair of eyes
blank with astonishment. It was as though
she had been asleep and he had rudely awakened
her. His infatuation blinded him to the
truth; he saw in the look a feminine desire to
throw the others off the track as to the sentiment
expressed in his whispered words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>The hour passed tolerably well. Herr
Rosen then observed the time, rose and excused
himself. He took the steps leading
abruptly down the terrace to the carriage road.
He had come by the other way, the rambling
stone stairs which began at the porter&#8217;s lodge,
back of the villa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Padre,&#8221; whispered Courtlandt, &#8220;I am
going. Do not follow. I shall explain to you
when we meet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The padre signified that he understood.
Harrigan protested vigorously, but smiling and
shaking his head, Courtlandt went away.</p>
<p>Nora ran to the window. She could see
Herr Rosen striding along, down the winding
road, his head in the air. Presently, from
behind a cluster of mulberries, the figure of
another man came into view. He was going
at a dog-trot, his hat settled at an angle that
permitted the rain to beat squarely into his
face. The next turn in the road shut them
both from sight. But Nora did not stir.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>Herr Rosen stopped and turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You called?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Courtlandt had caught up with
him just as Herr Rosen was about to open the
gates. &#8220;Just a moment, Herr Rosen,&#8221; with
a hand upon the bars. &#8220;I shall not detain
you long.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was studied insolence in the tones and
the gestures which accompanied them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be brief, if you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Edward Courtlandt, as doubtless
you have heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a large room it is difficult to remember
all the introductions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely. That is why I take the liberty
of recalling it to you, so that you will not forget
it,&#8221; urbanely.</p>
<p>A pause. Dark patches of water were
spreading across their shoulders. Little rivulets
ran down Courtlandt&#8217;s arm, raised as it
was against the bars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see how it may concern me,&#8221; replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
Herr Rosen finally with an insolence
more marked than Courtlandt&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Paris we met one night, at the stage
entrance of the Opera, I pushed you aside,
not knowing who you were. You had offered
your services; the door of Miss Harrigan&#8217;s
limousine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was you?&#8221; scowling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize for that. To-morrow morning
you will leave Bellaggio for Varenna.
Somewhere between nine and ten the fast train
leaves for Milan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Varenna! Milan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. You speak English as naturally
and fluently as if you were born to the tongue.
Thus, you will leave for Milan. What becomes
of you after that is of no consequence
to me. Am I making myself clear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Verdampt!</i> Do I believe my ears?&#8221; furiously.
&#8220;Are you telling me to leave Bellaggio
to-morrow morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As directly as I can.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>Herr Rosen&#8217;s face became as red as his
name. He was a brave young man, but there
was danger of an active kind in the blue eyes
boring into his own. If it came to a physical
contest, he realized that he would get the worst
of it. He put his hand to his throat; his very
impotence was choking him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Highness!&#8221; Herr Rosen stepped back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Your Highness will readily see the
wisdom of my concern for your hasty departure
when I add that I know all about the little
house in Versailles, that my knowledge is
shared by the chief of the Parisian police and
the minister of war. If you annoy Miss Harrigan
with your equivocal attentions....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Gott!</i> This is too much!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! I am stronger than you are. Do
not make me force you to hear me to the end.
You have gone about this intrigue like a blackguard,
and that I know your Highness not to
be. The matter is, you are young, you have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
always had your way, you have not learnt restraint.
Your presence here is an insult to
Miss Harrigan, and if she was pleasant to you
this afternoon it was for my benefit. If you
do not go, I shall expose you.&#8221; Courtlandt
opened the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I refuse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, in that case, being the American that
I am, without any particular reverence for
royalty or nobility, as it is known, I promise
to thrash you soundly to-morrow morning at
ten o&#8217;clock, in the dining-room, in the bureau,
the drawing-room, wherever I may happen to
find you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt turned on his heel and hurried
back to the villa. He did not look over his
shoulder. If he had, he might have felt pity
for the young man who leaned heavily against
the gate, his burning face pressed upon his
rain-soaked sleeve.</p>
<p>When Courtlandt knocked at the door and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
was admitted, he apologized. &#8220;I came back
for my umbrella.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Umbrella!&#8221; exclaimed the padre. &#8220;Why,
we had no umbrellas. We came up in a carriage
which is probably waiting for us this
very minute by the porter&#8217;s lodge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am certainly absent-minded!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absent-minded!&#8221; scoffed Abbott. &#8220;You
never forgot anything in all your life, unless it
was to go to bed. You wanted an excuse to
come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any excuse would be a good one in that
case. I think we&#8217;d better be going, Padre.
And by the way, Herr Rosen begged me to
present his regrets. He is leaving Bellaggio in
the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora turned her face once more to the window.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE APPLE OF DISCORD</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It is all very petty, my child,&#8221; said the
padre. &#8220;Life is made up of bigger
things; the little ones should be ignored.&#8221;</p>
<p>To which Nora replied: &#8220;To a woman,
the little things are everything; they are the
daily routine, the expected, the necessary
things. What you call the big things in life
are accidents. And, oh! I have pride.&#8221; She
folded her arms across her heaving bosom; for
the padre&#8217;s directness this morning had stirred
her deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilfulness is called pride by some; and
stubbornness. But you know, as well as I do,
that yours is resentment, anger, indignation.
Yes, you have pride, but it has not been
brought into this affair. Pride is that within
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
which prevents us from doing mean or sordid
acts; and you could not do one or the other
if you tried. The sentiment in you which
should be developed....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is mercy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; justice, the patience to weigh the
right or wrong of a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Padre, I have eyes, eyes; I <i>saw</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>He twirled the middle button of his cassock.
&#8220;The eyes see and the ears hear, but these are
only witnesses, laying the matter before the
court of the last resort, which is the mind.
It is there we sift the evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had the insufferable insolence to order
Herr Rosen to leave,&#8221; going around the barrier
of his well-ordered logic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Now, how could he send away Herr
Rosen if that gentleman had really preferred
to stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora looked confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you? I suspected; so I questioned
him last night. Had I been in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
place, I should have chastised Herr Rosen instead
of bidding him be gone. It was he.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora, sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Positively. The men who guarded you
were two actors from one of the theaters.
He did not come to Versailles because he was
being watched. He was found and sent home
the night before your release.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry. But it was so like <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The padre spread his hands. &#8220;What a way
women have of modifying either good or bad
impulses! It would have been fine of you to
have stopped when you said you were sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Padre, one would believe that you had
taken up his defense!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had I should have to leave it after
to-day. I return to Rome to-morrow and
shall not see you again before you go to
America. I have bidden good-by to all save
you. My child, my last admonition is, be patient;
observe; guard against that impulse born
in your blood to move hastily, to form opinions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
without solid foundations. Be happy
while you are young, for old age is happy only
in that reflected happiness of recollection.
Write to me, here. I return in November.
<i>Benedicite?</i>&#8221; smiling.</p>
<p>Nora bowed her head and he put a hand
upon it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;And listen to this,&#8221; began Harrigan, turning
over a page. &#8220;&#8216;It is considered bad form
to call the butler to your side when you are a
guest. Catch his eye. He will understand
that something is wanted.&#8217; How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to live.&#8221; Courtlandt
grinned, and tilted back his chair until it rested
against the oak.</p>
<p>The morning was clear and mild. Fresh
snow lay upon the mountain tops; later it
would disappear. The fountain tinkled, and
swallows darted hither and thither under the
sparkling spray. The gardeners below in the
vegetable patch were singing. By the door of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
the villa sat two old ladies, breakfasting in the
sunshine. There was a hint of lavender in the
lazy drifting air. A dozen yards away sat
Abbott, two or three brushes between his teeth
and one in his hand. A little behind was
Celeste, sewing posies upon one of those
squares of linen toward which all women in
their idle moments are inclined, and which,
on finishing, they immediately stow away in
the bottom of some trunk against the day when
they have a home of their own, or marry, or
find some one ignorant enough to accept it as
a gift.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And when in doubt,&#8217;&#8221; continued Harrigan,
&#8220;&#8216;watch how other persons use their
forks.&#8217; Can you beat it? And say, honest,
Molly bought that for me to read and study.
And I never piped the subtitle until this morning.
&#8216;Advice to young ladies upon going into
society.&#8217; Huh?&#8221; Harrigan slapped his knee
with the book and roared out his keen enjoyment.
Somehow he seemed to be more at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
ease with this young fellow than with any
other man he had met in years. &#8220;But for the
love of Mike, don&#8217;t say anything to Molly,&#8221;
fearfully. &#8220;Oh, she means the best in the
world,&#8221; contritely. &#8220;I&#8217;m always embarrassing
her; shoe-strings that don&#8217;t match, a busted
stud in my shirt-front, and there isn&#8217;t a pair
of white-kids made that&#8217;ll stay whole more
than five minutes on these paws. I suppose it&#8217;s
because I don&#8217;t think. After all, I&#8217;m only a
retired pug.&#8221; The old fellow&#8217;s eyes sparkled
suspiciously. &#8220;The best two women in all
the world, and I don&#8217;t want them to be
ashamed of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Harrigan,&#8221; said Courtlandt, letting
his chair fall into place so that he could
lay a hand affectionately upon the other&#8217;s knee,
&#8220;neither of them would be worth their salt if
they ever felt ashamed of you. What do you
care what strangers think or say? You know.
You&#8217;ve seen life. You&#8217;ve stepped off the stage
and carried with you the recollection of decent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
living, of playing square, of doing the best you
could. The worst scoundrels I ever met never
made any mistake with their forks. Perhaps
you don&#8217;t know it, but my father became rich
because he could judge a man&#8217;s worth almost
at sight. And he kept this fortune and added
to it because he chose half a dozen friends
and refused to enlarge the list. If you became
his friend, he had good reason for making you
such.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we did have some good times together,&#8221;
Harrigan admitted, with a glow in
his heart. &#8220;And I guess after all that I&#8217;ll go
to the ball with Molly. I don&#8217;t mind teas like
we had at the colonel&#8217;s, but dinners and balls
I have drawn the line at. I&#8217;ll take the plunge
to-night. There&#8217;s always some place for a
chap to smoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Villa Rosa? I&#8217;ll be there myself;
and any time you are in doubt, don&#8217;t be afraid
to question me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in class A,&#8221; heartily. &#8220;But there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
one thing that worries me,&mdash;Nora. She&#8217;s
gone up so high, and she&#8217;s such a wonderful
girl, that all the men in Christendom are hiking
after her. And some of &#8217;em....
Well, Molly says it isn&#8217;t good form to wallop
a man over here. Why, she went on her lonesome
to India and Japan, with nobody but her
maid; and never put us hep until she landed in
Bombay. The men out that way aren&#8217;t the
best. East of Suez, you know. And that
chap yesterday, Herr Rosen. Did you see the
way he hiked by me when I let him in? He
took me to be the round number before one.
And he didn&#8217;t speak a dozen words to any but
Nora. Not that I mind that; but it was something
in the way he did it that scratched me
the wrong way. The man who thinks he&#8217;s
going to get Nora by walking over me, has got
a guess coming. Of course, it&#8217;s meat and
drink to Molly to have sons of grand dukes
and kings trailing around. She says it gives
tone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she afraid sometimes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid? I should say not! There&#8217;s only
three things that Molly&#8217;s afraid of these days:
a spool of thread, a needle, and a button.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt laughed frankly. &#8220;I really
don&#8217;t think you need worry about Herr Rosen.
He has gone, and he will not come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say! I&#8217;ll bet a dollar it was you who
shoo&#8217;d him off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But it was undoubtedly an impertinence
on my part, and I&#8217;d rather you would
not disclose my officiousness to Miss Harrigan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Piffle! If you knew him you had a perfect
right to pass him back his ticket. Who
was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt poked at the gravel with his cane.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the big guns?&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;So big that he couldn&#8217;t have married my
girl even if he loved her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. As big as that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>Harrigan riffled the leaves of his book.
&#8220;What do you say to going down to the hotel
and having a game of <i>bazzica</i>, as they call
billiards here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing would please me better,&#8221; said
Courtlandt, relieved that Harrigan did not
press him for further revelations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora is studying a new opera, and
Molly-O is ragging the village dressmaker.
It&#8217;s only half after ten, and we can whack &#8217;em
around until noon. I warn you, I&#8217;m something
of a shark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lay you the cigars that I beat you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrigan put the book in his pocket, and the
two of them made for the upper path, not,
however, without waving a friendly adieu to
Celeste, who was watching them with much
curiosity.</p>
<p>For a moment Nora became visible in the
window. Her expression did not signify that
the sight of the men together pleased her. On
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
the contrary, her eyes burned and her brow
was ruffled by several wrinkles which threatened
to become permanent if the condition of
affairs continued to remain as it was. To
her the calm placidity of the man was nothing
less than monumental impudence. How she
hated him; how bitterly, how intensely she
hated him! She withdrew from the window
without having been seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see two finer specimens of
man?&#8221; Celeste asked of Abbott.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Who?&#8221; mumbled Abbott, whose
forehead was puckered with impatience.
&#8220;Oh, those two? They <i>are</i> well set up. But
what the deuce <i>is</i> the matter with this foreground?&#8221;
taking the brushes from his teeth.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been hammering away at it for a week,
and it does not get there yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Celeste rose and laid aside her work. She
stood behind him and studied the picture
through half-closed critical eyes. &#8220;You have
painted it over too many times.&#8221; Then she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
looked down at the shapely head. Ah, the
longing to put her hands upon it, to run her
fingers through the tousled hair, to touch it
with her lips! But no! &#8220;Perhaps you are
tired; perhaps you have worked too hard.
Why not put aside your brushes for a week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a good mind to chuck it into the lake.
I simply can&#8217;t paint any more.&#8221; He flung
down the brushes. &#8220;I&#8217;m a fool, Celeste, a
fool. I&#8217;m crying for the moon, that&#8217;s what
the matter is. What&#8217;s the use of beating
about the bush? You know as well as I do
that it&#8217;s Nora.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her heart contracted, and for a little while
she could not see him clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what earthly chance have I?&#8221; he went
on, innocently but ruthlessly. &#8220;No one can
help loving Nora.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; in a small voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all rot, this talk about affinities.
There&#8217;s always some poor devil left outside.
But who can help loving Nora?&#8221; he repeated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s not the least chance in the
world for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never can tell until you put it to the
test.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I have a chance? Is it possible
that Nora may care a little for me?&#8221;
He turned his head toward her eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; She wanted him to have
it over with, to learn the truth that to Nora
Harrigan he would never be more than an
amiable comrade. He would then have none
to turn to but her. What mattered it if her
own heart ached so she might soothe the hurt
in his? She laid a hand upon his shoulder, so
lightly that he was only dimly conscious of
the contact.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rummy old world. Here I&#8217;ve gone
alone all these years....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-six!&#8221; smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a long time. Never bothered
my head about a woman. Selfish, perhaps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
Had a good time, came and went as I pleased.
And then I met Nora.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If only she&#8217;d been stand-offish, like these
other singers, why, I&#8217;d have been all right
to-day. But she&#8217;s such a brick! She&#8217;s such
a good fellow! She treats us all alike; sings
when we ask her to; always ready for a romp.
Think of her making us all take the <i>Kneip</i>-cure
the other night! And we marched
around the fountain singing &#8216;Mary had a little
lamb.&#8217; Barefooted in the grass! When a
man marries he doesn&#8217;t want a wife half so
much as a good comrade; somebody to slap
him on the back in the morning to hearten him
up for the day&#8217;s work; and to cuddle him up
when he comes home tired, or disappointed,
or unsuccessful. No matter what mood he&#8217;s
in. Is my English getting away from you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I understand all you say.&#8221; Her
hand rested a trifle heavier upon his shoulder,
that was all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nora would be that kind of a wife.
&#8216;Honor, anger, valor, fire,&#8217; as Stevenson says.
Hang the picture; what am I going to do with
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Honor, anger, valor, fire,&#8217;&#8221; Celeste repeated
slowly. &#8220;Yes, that is Nora.&#8221; A bitter
little smile moved her lips as she recalled
the happenings of the last two days. But no;
he must find out for himself; he must meet the
hurt from Nora, not from her. &#8220;How long,
Abbott, have you known your friend Mr.
Courtlandt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys together,&#8221; playing a light tattoo with
his mahl-stick.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About thirty-two or three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is very rich?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oceans of money; throws it away, but not
fast enough to get rid of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is what you say in English ... wild?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; with mock gravity, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
like to be the tiger that crossed his path.
Wild; that&#8217;s the word for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are laughing. Ah, I know! I
should say dissipated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Courtlandt? Come, now, Celeste; does he
look dissipated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He drinks when he chooses, he flirts with
a pretty woman when he chooses, he smokes
the finest tobacco there is when he chooses;
and he gives them all up when he chooses.
He is like the seasons; he comes and goes, and
nobody can change his habits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has had no affair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Courtlandt hasn&#8217;t any heart. It&#8217;s a
mechanical device to keep his blood in circulation;
that&#8217;s all. I am the most intimate friend
he has, and yet I know no more than you how
he lives and where he goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She let her hand fall from his shoulder.
She was glad that he did not know.</p>
<p>&#8220;But look!&#8221; she cried in warning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>Abbott looked.</p>
<p>A woman was coming serenely down the
path from the wooded promontory, a woman
undeniably handsome in a cedar-tinted linen
dress, exquisitely fashioned, with a touch of
vivid scarlet on her hat and a most tantalizing
flash of scarlet ankle. It was Flora Desimone,
fresh from her morning bath and a substantial
breakfast. The errand that had brought her
from Aix-les-Bains was confessedly a merciful
one. But she possessed the dramatist&#8217;s
instinct to prolong a situation. Thus, to make
her act of mercy seem infinitely larger than it
was, she was determined first to cast the Apple
of Discord into this charming corner of Eden.
The Apple of Discord, as every man knows, is
the only thing a woman can throw with any
accuracy.</p>
<p>The artist snatched up his brushes, and
ruined the painting forthwith, for all time.
The foreground was, in his opinion, beyond
redemption; so, with a savage humor, he rapidly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
limned in a score of impossible trees,
turned midday into sunset, with a riot of colors
which would have made the Chinese New-year
in Canton a drab and sober event in comparison.
He hated Flora Desimone, as all Nora&#8217;s
adherents most properly did, but with a hatred
wholly reflective and adapted to Nora&#8217;s moods.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have spoiled it!&#8221; cried Celeste. She
had watched the picture grow, and to see it
ruthlessly destroyed this way hurt her.
&#8220;How could you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worst I ever did.&#8221; He began to change
the whole effect, chuckling audibly as he
worked. Sunset divided honors with moonlight.
It was no longer incongruous; it was
ridiculous. He leaned back and laughed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to send it to L&#8217;Asino, and call it
an afterthought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! I&#8217;m going to touch a match to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
it. I&#8217;ll give you that picture with the lavender
in bloom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can not hang it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; The more he learned about
women the farther out of mental reach they
seemed to go. Why on earth did she want
this execrable daub? &#8220;You may have it; but
all the same, I&#8217;m going to call an oculist and
have him examine your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it is the Signorina Fournier!&#8221;</p>
<p>In preparing studiously to ignore Flora
Desimone&#8217;s presence they had forgotten all
about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Signora,&#8221; said Celeste in
Italian.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Signore Abbott, the painter,
also!&#8221; The Calabrian raised what she considered
her most deadly weapon, her lorgnette.</p>
<p>Celeste had her fancy-work instantly in her
two hands; Abbott&#8217;s were occupied; Flora&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
hands were likewise engaged; thus, the insipid
mockery of hand-shaking was nicely and excusably
avoided.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Flora, squinting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a new style of the impressionist which
I began this morning,&#8221; soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks very natural,&#8221; observed Flora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Natural!&#8221; Abbott dropped his mahl-stick.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Vesuv&#8217;, is it not, on a cloudy day?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was too much for Abbott&#8217;s gravity, and
he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not necessary to spoil a good picture ... on
my account,&#8221; said Flora,
closing the lorgnette with a snap. Her great
dark eyes were dreamy and contemplative like
a cat&#8217;s, and, as every one knows, a cat&#8217;s eye is
the most observing of all eyes. It is quite in
the order of things, since a cat&#8217;s attitude toward
the world is by need and experience
wholly defensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Signora is wrong. I did not spoil it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
on her account. It was past helping yesterday.
But I shall, however, rechristen it Vesuvius,
since it represents an eruption of
temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flora tapped the handle of her parasol with
the lorgnette. It was distinctly a sign of approval.
These Americans were never slow-witted.
She swung the parasol to and fro,
slowly, like a pendulum.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad,&#8221; she said, her glance roving
over the white walls of the villa.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was irrevocably lost,&#8221; Abbott declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; I do not mean the picture. I am
thinking of La Toscana. Her voice was really
superb; and to lose it entirely...!&#8221; She
waved a sympathetic hand.</p>
<p>Abbott was about to rise up in vigorous protest.
But fate itself chose to rebuke Flora.
From the window came&mdash;&#8220;<i>Sai cos&#8217; ebbe
cuore!</i>&#8221;&mdash;sung as only Nora could sing it.</p>
<p>The ferrule of Flora Desimone&#8217;s parasol bit
deeply into the clover-turf.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE BALL AT THE VILLA</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the Duchessa?&#8221; asked
Flora Desimone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; It was three o&#8217;clock the same
afternoon. The duke sat with his wife under
the vine-clad trattoria on the quay. Between
his knees he held his Panama hat, which was
filled with ripe hazelnuts. He cracked them
vigorously with his strong white teeth and
filliped the broken shells into the lake, where
a frantic little fish called <i>agoni</i> darted in and
about the slowly sinking particles. &#8220;Why?&#8221;
The duke was not any grayer than he had been
four or five months previous, but the characteristic
expression of his features had undergone
a change. He looked less Jovian than
Job-like.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to get an invitation to her ball
at the Villa Rosa to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t been here twenty-four hours!&#8221;
in mild protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has that to do with it? It doesn&#8217;t
make any difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not.&#8221; He cracked and ate a
nut. &#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has gone to Milan. He left hurriedly.
He&#8217;s a fool,&#8221; impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not necessarily. Foolishness is one thing
and discretion is another. Oh, well; his presence
here was not absolutely essential. Presently
he will marry and settle down and be a
good boy.&#8221; The next nut was withered, and
he tossed it aside. &#8220;Is her voice really
gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Flora leaned with her arms upon
the railing and glared at the wimpling water.
She had carried the Apple of Discord up the
hill and down again. Nora had been indisposed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned the glare upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad of that, considering your
part in the affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael...!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful. Michael is always a prelude
to a temper. Have one of these,&#8221; offering a
nut.</p>
<p>She struck it rudely from his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I am tempted to put my two
hands around that exquisite neck of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I do not believe it would be wise. But
if ever I find out that you have lied to me,
that you loved the fellow and married me out
of spite....&#8221; He completed the sentence
by suggestively crunching a nut.</p>
<p>The sullen expression on her face gave place
to a smile. &#8220;I should like to see you in a
rage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my heart; you would like nothing of
the sort. I understand you better than you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
know; that accounts for my patience. You
are Italian. You are caprice and mood. I
come from a cold land. If ever I do get
angry, run, run as fast as ever you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flora was not, among other things, frivolous
or light-headed. There was an earthquake
hidden somewhere in this quiet docile man, and
the innate deviltry of the woman was always
trying to dig down to it. But she never deceived
herself. Some day this earthquake
would open up and devour her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate him. He snubbed me. I have told
you that a thousand times.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed and rattled the nuts in his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to get that invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I do not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall return immediately to Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And break your word to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As easily as you break one of these nuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I get the invitation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall fulfil my promise to the letter. I
will tell her as I promised.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Out of love for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of love for you, and because the play
no longer interests me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what new devilment is at work
in your mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael, I do not want to get into a temper.
It makes lines in my face. I hate this
place. It is dead. I want life, and color, and
music. I want the rest of September in
Ostend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paris, Capri, Taormina, Ostend; I marvel
if ever you will be content to stay in one place
long enough for me to get my breath?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, I am young. One of these days
I shall be content to sit by your great Russian
fireplace and hold your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed and pressed his hand between
her own. &#8220;Michael, look me straight in the
eyes.&#8221; He did so willingly enough. &#8220;There
is no other man. And if you ever look at another
woman ... Well!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send over for the invitation.&#8221; He
stuffed his pockets with nuts and put on his
hat.</p>
<p>Flora then proceeded secretly to polish once
more the Apple of Discord which, a deal tarnished
for lack of use, she had been compelled
to bring down from the promontory.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Am I all right?&#8221; asked Harrigan.</p>
<p>Courtlandt nodded. &#8220;You look like a
soldier in mufti, and more than that, like the
gentleman that you naturally are,&#8221; quite sincerely.</p>
<p>The ex-gladiator blushed. &#8220;This is the reception-room.
There&#8217;s the ballroom right
out there. The smoking-room is on the other
side. Now, how in the old Harry am I going
to get across without killing some one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt resisted the desire to laugh.
&#8220;Supposing you let me pilot you over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the referee. Ring the gong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, then.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What! while they are dancing?&#8221; backing
away in dismay.</p>
<p>The other caught him by the arm. &#8220;Come
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in and out they went, hither and
thither, now dodging, now pausing to let the
swirl pass, until at length Harrigan found
himself safe on shore, in the dim cool smoking-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you did it,&#8221; admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop in every little while to see how
you are getting on,&#8221; volunteered Courtlandt.
&#8220;You can sit by the door if you care to see
them dance. I&#8217;m off to see Mrs. Harrigan and
tell her where you are. Here&#8217;s a cigar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrigan turned the cigar over and over in
his fingers, all the while gazing at the young
man&#8217;s diminishing back. He sighed. <i>That</i>
would make him the happiest man in the world.
He examined the carnelian band encircling
the six-inches of evanescent happiness.
&#8220;What do you think of that!&#8221; he murmured.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
&#8220;Same brand the old boy used to smoke.
And if he pays anything less than sixty apiece
for &#8217;em at wholesale, I&#8217;ll eat this one.&#8221; Then
he directed his attention to the casual inspection
of the room. A few elderly men
were lounging about. His sympathy was at
once mutely extended; it was plain that they
too had been dragged out. At the little
smoker&#8217;s tabouret by the door he espied two
chairs, one of which was unoccupied; and he
at once appropriated it. The other chair was
totally obscured by the bulk of the man who
sat in it; a man, bearded, blunt-nosed, passive,
but whose eyes were bright and twinkling.
Hanging from his cravat was a medal of some
kind. Harrigan lighted his cigar, and gave
himself up to the delights of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should leave us old fellows at home,&#8221;
he ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, in most cases, the women would
much prefer that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreigner,&#8221; thought Harrigan. &#8220;Well, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
does seem that the older we get the greater
obstruction we become.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is old age?&#8221; asked the thick but not
unpleasant voice of the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s standing aside. Years don&#8217;t count at
all. A man is as young as he feels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a woman as old as she looks!&#8221;
laughed the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I don&#8217;t feel old, and I am fifty-one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man with the beard shot an admiring
glance across the tabouret. &#8220;You are extraordinarily
well preserved, sir. You do not seem
older than I, and I am but forty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is, over here you play cards
all night in stuffy rooms and eat too many
sauces.&#8221; Harrigan had read this somewhere,
and he was pleased to think that he could recall
it so fittingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed. You Americans are getting out
in the open more than any other white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder how he guessed I was from the
States?&#8221; Aloud, Harrigan said: &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
don&#8217;t look as though you&#8217;d grow any older in
the next ten years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends.&#8221; The bearded man sighed
and lighted a fresh cigarette. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
beautiful young woman,&#8221; with an indicative
gesture toward the ballroom.</p>
<p>Harrigan expanded. It was Nora, dancing
with the Barone.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the most beautiful young woman in
the world,&#8221; enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you know her?&#8221; interestedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am her father!&#8221;&mdash;as Louis XIV might
have said, &#8220;I am the State.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bearded man smiled. &#8220;Sir, I congratulate
you both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt loomed in the doorway. &#8220;Comfortable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly. Good cigar, comfortable chair,
fine view.&#8221;</p>
<p>The duke eyed Courtlandt through the pall
of smoke which he had purposefully blown
forth. He questioned, rather amusedly, what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
would have happened had he gone down to
the main hall that night in Paris? Among the
few things he admired was a well-built handsome
man. Courtlandt on his part pretended
that he did not see.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find the claret and champagne
punches in the hall,&#8221; suggested Courtlandt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for mine! Run away and dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, then.&#8221; Courtlandt vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a fine chap. Edward Courtlandt,
the American millionaire.&#8221; It was not possible
for Harrigan to omit this awe-compelling
elaboration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Edward Courtlandt.&#8221; The stranger
stretched his legs. &#8220;I have heard of him.
Something of a hunter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the keenest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no half-way with your rich
American: either his money ruins him or he
runs away from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a stunner,&#8221; exclaimed Harrigan.
&#8220;Wonder how she got here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To which lady do you refer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one in scarlet. She is Flora Desimone.
She and my daughter sing together
sometimes. Of course you have heard of
Eleonora da Toscana; that&#8217;s my daughter&#8217;s
stage name. The two are not on very good
terms, naturally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite naturally,&#8221; dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t get away from the Calabrian&#8217;s
beauty,&#8221; generously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The bearded man extinguished his
cigarette and rose, laying a <i>carte-de-visite</i> on
the tabouret. &#8220;More, I should not care to get
away from it. Good evening,&#8221; pleasantly.
The music stopped. He passed on into the
crowd.</p>
<p>Harrigan reached over and picked up the
card. &#8220;Suffering shamrocks! if Molly could
only see me now,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I wonder
if I made any breaks? The grand duke, and
me hobnobbing with him like a waiter!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
James, this is all under your hat. We&#8217;ll keep
the card where Molly won&#8217;t find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Young men began to drift in and out. The
air became heavy with smoke, the prevailing
aroma being that of Turkish tobacco of which
Harrigan was not at all fond. But his cigar
was so good that he was determined not to
stir until the coal began to tickle the end of
his nose. Since Molly knew where he was
there was no occasion to worry.</p>
<p>Abbott came in, pulled a cigarette case out
of his pocket, and impatiently struck a match.
His hands shook a little, and the flare of the
match revealed a pale and angry countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Abbott, here&#8217;s a seat. Get your second
wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221; Abbott dropped into the chair
and smoked quickly. &#8220;Very stuffy out there.
Too many.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look it. Having a good time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fine!&#8221; There was a catch in the
laugh which followed, but Harrigan&#8217;s ear was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
not trained for these subtleties of sound,
&#8220;How are you making out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting acclimated. Where&#8217;s the
colonel to-night? He ought to be around here
somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I left him a few moments ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you see him again, send him in.
He&#8217;s a live one, and I like to hear him talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go at once,&#8221; crushing his cigarette in
the Jeypore bowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your hurry? You look like a man
who has just lost his job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Been steering a German countess. She
was wound up to turn only one way, and I am
groggy. I&#8217;ll send the colonel over. By-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what&#8217;s stung the boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora was enjoying herself famously. The
men hummed around her like bees around the
sweetest rose. From time to time she saw
Courtlandt hovering about the outskirts. She
was glad he had come: the lepidopterist is
latent or active in most women; to impale the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
butterfly, the moth falls easily into the daily
routine. She was laughing and jesting with
the men. Her mother stood by, admiringly.
This time Courtlandt gently pushed his way
to Nora&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have a dance?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too late,&#8221; evenly. She was becoming
used to the sight of him, much to her
amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Nora, I didn&#8217;t know that your card
was filled!&#8221; said Mrs. Harrigan. She had
the maternal eye upon Courtlandt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; said Nora sweetly, &#8220;it is
a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am disconsolate,&#8221; replied Courtlandt,
who had approached for form&#8217;s sake only, being
fully prepared for a refusal. &#8220;I have the
unfortunate habit of turning up late,&#8221; with a
significance which only Nora understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, those who are late must suffer the consequences.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Supper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Barone rather than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The music began again, and Abbott whirled
her away. She was dressed in Burmese taffeta,
a rich orange. In the dark of her beautiful
black hair there was the green luster of
emeralds; an Indian-princess necklace of emeralds
and pearls was looped around her dazzling
white throat. Unconsciously Courtlandt
sighed audibly, and Mrs. Harrigan heard this
note of unrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221; asked Mrs. Harrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flora Desimone&#8217;s husband, the duke. He
and Mr. Harrigan were having quite a conversation
in the smoke-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; in consternation.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were getting along finely when I left
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harrigan felt her heart sink. The
duke and James together meant nothing short
of a catastrophe; for James would not know
whom he was addressing, and would make all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
manner of confidences. She knew something
would happen if she let him out of her sight.
He was eternally talking to strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling Mr. Harrigan that
I wish to see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora stopped at the end of the ballroom.
&#8220;Donald, let us go out into the garden. I
want a breath of air. Did you see her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t help seeing her. It was the duke,
I suppose. It appears that he is an old friend
of the duchess. We&#8217;ll go through the conservatory.
It&#8217;s a short-cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>The night was full of moonshine; it danced
upon the water; it fired the filigree tops of the
solemn cypress; it laced the lawn with quivering
shadows; and heavy hung the cloying perfume
of the box-wood hedges.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>O bellissima notta!</i>&#8221; she sang. &#8220;Is it not
glorious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora,&#8221; said Abbott, leaning suddenly
toward her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it. Donald; please don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t
waste your love on me. You are a good man,
and I should not be worthy the name of
woman if I did not feel proud and sad. I
want you always as a friend; and if you decide
that can not be, I shall lose faith in everything.
I have never had a brother, and in
these two short years I have grown to look
on you as one. I am sorry. But if you
will look back you will see that I never gave
you any encouragement. I was never more
than your comrade. I have many faults, but
I am not naturally a coquette. I know my
heart; I know it well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there another?&#8221; in despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once upon a time, Donald, there was.
There is nothing now but ashes. I am telling
you this so that it will not be so hard for
you to return to the old friendly footing.
You are a brave man. Any man is who takes
his heart in his hand and offers it to a woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
You are going to take my hand and promise
to be my friend always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Nora!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t, Donald. I can&#8217;t return to
the ballroom with my eyes red. You will
never know how a woman on the stage has
to fight to earn her bread. And that part is
only a skirmish compared to the ceaseless war
men wage against her. She has only the fortifications
of her wit and her presence of mind.
Was I not abducted in the heart of Paris?
And but for the cowardice of the man, who
knows what might have happened? If I have
beauty, God gave it to me to wear, and wear
it I will. My father, the padre, you and the
Barone; I would not trust any other men living.
I am often unhappy, but I do not inflict
this unhappiness on others. Be you the
same. Be my friend; be brave and fight it
out of your heart.&#8221; Quickly she drew his
head toward her and lightly kissed the forehead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
&#8220;There! Ah, Donald, I very much
need a friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Nora,&#8221; bravely indeed, for the
pain in his young heart cried out for the ends
of the earth in which to hide. &#8220;All right!
I&#8217;m young; maybe I&#8217;ll get over it in time.
Always count on me. You wouldn&#8217;t mind
going back to the ballroom alone, would you?
I&#8217;ve got an idea I&#8217;d like to smoke over it. No,
I&#8217;ll take you to the end of the conservatory and
come back. I can&#8217;t face the rest of them just
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora had hoped against hope that it was
only infatuation, but in the last few days she
could not ignore the truth that he really loved
her. She had thrown him and Celeste together
in vain. Poor Celeste, poor lovely Celeste,
who wore her heart upon her sleeve, patent
to all eyes save Donald&#8217;s! Thus, it was with
defined purpose that she had lured him this
night into the garden. She wanted to disillusion
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>The Barone, glooming in an obscure corner
of the conservatory, saw them come in. Abbott&#8217;s
brave young face deceived him. At the
door Abbott smiled and bowed and returned
to the garden. The Barone rose to follow
him. He had committed a theft of which he
was genuinely sorry; and he was man enough
to seek his rival and apologize. But fate had
chosen for him the worst possible time. He
had taken but a step forward, when a tableau
formed by the door, causing him to pause
irresolutely.</p>
<p>Nora was face to face at last with Flora
Desimone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to speak to you,&#8221; said the Italian
abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing you could possibly say would interest
me,&#8221; declared Nora, haughtily and made
as if to pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be too sure,&#8221; insolently.</p>
<p>Their voices were low, but they reached the
ears of the Barone, who wished he was anywhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
but here. He moved silently behind
the palms toward the exit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me be frank. I hate you and detest
you with all my heart,&#8221; continued Flora. &#8220;I
have always hated you, with your supercilious
airs, you, whose father....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare to say an ill word of
him!&#8221; cried Nora, her Irish blood throwing
hauteur to the winds. &#8220;He is kind and brave
and loyal, and I am proud of him. Say what
you will about me; it will not bother me in
the least.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Barone heard no more. By degrees he
had reached the exit, and he was mightily relieved
to get outside. The Calabrian had
chosen her time well, for the conservatory was
practically empty. The Barone&#8217;s eyes searched
the shadows and at length discerned Abbott
leaning over the parapet.</p>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Abbott, facing about. &#8220;So it
is you. You deliberately scratched off my
name and substituted your own. It was the
act of a contemptible cad. And I tell you here
and now. A cad!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Barone was Italian. He had sought
Abbott with the best intentions; to apologize
abjectly, distasteful though it might be to his
hot blood. Instead, he struck Abbott across
the mouth, and the latter promptly knocked
him down.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>PISTOLS FOR TWO</h3>
</div>

<p>Courtlandt knocked on the studio
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He discovered Abbott, stretched out upon
the lounge, idly picking at the loose plaster in
the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Abbott carelessly. &#8220;Help
yourself to a chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, Courtlandt walked about the room,
aimlessly. He paused at the window; he
picked up a sketch and studied it at various
angles; he kicked the footstool across the floor,
not with any sign of anger but with a seriousness
that would have caused Abbott to laugh,
had he been looking at his friend. He continued,
however, to pluck at the plaster. He
had always hated and loved Courtlandt, alternately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
He never sought to analyze this
peculiar cardiac condition. He only knew
that at one time he hated the man, and that
at another he would have laid down his life
for him. Perhaps it was rather a passive
jealousy which he mistook for hatred. Abbott
had never envied Courtlandt his riches;
but often the sight of Courtlandt&#8217;s physical
superiority, his adaptability, his knowledge
of men and affairs, the way he had of
anticipating the unspoken wishes of women,
his unembarrassed gallantry, these attributes
stirred the envy of which he was always
manly enough to be ashamed. Courtlandt&#8217;s
unexpected appearance in Bellaggio had also
created a suspicion which he could not minutely
define. The truth was, when a man
loved, every other man became his enemy, not
excepting her father: the primordial instinct
has survived all the applications of veneer.
So, Abbott was not at all pleased to see his
friend that morning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>At length Courtlandt returned to the lounge.
&#8220;The Barone called upon me this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you had better write him an
apology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abbott sat up. He flung the piece of plaster
violently to the floor. &#8220;Apologize? Well, I
like your nerve to come here with that kind
of wabble. Look at these lips! Man, he
struck me across the mouth, and I knocked him
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a pretty good wallop, considering
that you couldn&#8217;t see his face very well in the
dark. I always said that you had more spunk
to the square inch than any other chap I know.
But over here, Suds, as you know, it&#8217;s different.
You can&#8217;t knock down an officer and get away
with it. So, you just sit down at your desk
and write a little note, saying that you regret
your hastiness. I&#8217;ll see that it goes through
all right. Fortunately, no one heard of the
row.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you both farther!&#8221; wrathfully.
&#8220;Look at these lips, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before he struck you, you must have given
provocation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t discuss what took place. Nor will
I apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s final?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have my word for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry. The Barone is a decent
sort. He gives you the preference, and suggests
that you select pistols, since you would
be no match for him with rapiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pistols!&#8221; shouted Abbott. &#8220;For the love
of glory, what are you driving at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Barone has asked me to be his
second. And I have despatched a note to the
colonel, advising him to attend to your side.
I accepted the Barone&#8217;s proposition solely that
I might get here first and convince you that an
apology will save you a heap of discomfort.
The Barone is a first-rate shot, and doubtless
he will only wing you. But that will mean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
scandal and several weeks in the hospital, to
say nothing of a devil of a row with the civil
authorities. In the army the Italian still
fights his <i>duello</i>, but these affairs never get
into the newspapers, as in France. Seldom,
however, is any one seriously hurt. They are
excitable, and consequently a good shot is
likely to shoot wildly at a pinch. So there
you are, my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in your right mind? Do you
mean to tell me that you have come here to
arrange a duel?&#8221; asked Abbott, his voice low
and a bit shaky.</p>
<p>&#8220;To prevent one. So, write your apology.
Don&#8217;t worry about the moral side of the question.
It&#8217;s only a fool who will offer himself
as a target to a man who knows how to shoot.
You couldn&#8217;t hit the broadside of a barn with
a shot-gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abbott brushed the dust from his coat and
got up. &#8220;A duel!&#8221; He laughed a bit hysterically.
Well, why not? Since Nora could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
never be his, there was no future for him.
He might far better serve as a target than
to go on living with the pain and bitterness
in his heart. &#8220;Very well. Tell the Barone
my choice is pistols. He may set the time
and place himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go over to that desk and write that
apology. If you don&#8217;t, I promise on my part
to tell Nora Harrigan, who, I dare say, is at
the bottom of this, innocently or otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Courtlandt!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean just what I say. Take your
choice. Stop this nonsense yourself like a reasonable
human being, or let Nora Harrigan
stop it for you. There will be no duel, not if
I can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abbott saw instantly what would happen.
Nora would go to the Barone and beg off for
him. &#8220;All right! I&#8217;ll write that apology.
But listen: you will knock hereafter when
you enter any of my studios. You&#8217;ve kicked
out the bottom from the old footing. You are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
not the friend you profess to be. You are
making me a coward in the eyes of that
damned Italian. He will never understand
this phase of it.&#8221; Thereupon Abbott ran over
to his desk and scribbled the note, sealing it
with a bang. &#8220;Here you are. Perhaps you
had best go at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abby, I&#8217;m sorry that you take this view.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to hear any platitudes, thank
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look you up to-morrow, and on my
part I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t ask for any apology. In a
little while you&#8217;ll thank me. You will even
laugh with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Permit me to doubt that,&#8221; angrily. He
threw open the door.</p>
<p>Courtlandt was too wise to argue further.
He had obtained the object of his errand, and
that was enough for the present. &#8220;Sorry you
are not open to reason. Good morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the door closed, Abbott tramped the
floor and vented his temper on the much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
abused footstool, which he kicked whenever it
came in the line of his march. In his soul
he knew that Courtlandt was right. More
than that, he knew that presently he would
seek him and apologize.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither of them counted on
the colonel.</p>
<p>Without being quite conscious of the act,
Abbott took down from the wall an ancient
dueling-pistol, cocked it, snapped it, and
looked it over with an interest that he had
never before bestowed on it. And the colonel,
bursting into the studio, found him absorbed
in the contemplation of this old death-dealing
instrument.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; roared the old war dog. &#8220;Had an
idea that something like this was going to
happen. Put that up. You couldn&#8217;t kill anything
with that unless you hit &#8217;em on the
head with it. Leave the matter to me.
I&#8217;ve a pair of pistols, sighted to hit a shilling
at twenty yards. Of course, you can&#8217;t fight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
him with swords. He&#8217;s one of the best in
all Italy. But you&#8217;ve just as good a chance as
he has with pistols. Nine times out of ten
the tyro hits the bull&#8217;s-eye, while the crack
goes wild. Just you sit jolly tight. Who&#8217;s
his second; Courtlandt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Abbott was truly and completely
bewildered.</p>
<p>&#8220;He struck you first, I understand, and
you knocked him down. Good! My tennis-courts
are out of the way. We can settle
this matter to-morrow morning at dawn.
Ellicott will come over from Cadenabbia with
his saws. He&#8217;s close-mouthed. All you need
to do is to keep quiet. You can spend the
night at the villa with me, and I&#8217;ll give you
a few ideas about shooting a pistol. Here;
write what I dictate.&#8221; He pushed Abbott over
to the desk and forced him into the chair.
Abbott wrote mechanically, as one hypnotized.
The colonel seized the letter. &#8220;No flowery
sentences; a few words bang at the mark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
Come up to the villa as soon as you can. We&#8217;ll
jolly well cool this Italian&#8217;s blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>And out he went, banging the door. There
was something of the directness of a bullet in
the old fellow&#8217;s methods.</p>
<p>Literally, Abbott had been rushed off his
feet. The moment his confusion cleared he
saw the predicament into which his own
stupidity and the amiable colonel&#8217;s impetuous
good offices had plunged him. He was horrified.
Here was Courtlandt carrying the
apology, and hot on his heels was the colonel,
with the final arrangements for the meeting.
He ran to the door, bareheaded, took the stairs
three and four at a bound. But the energetic
Anglo-Indian had gone down in bounds also;
and when the distracted artist reached the
street, the other was nowhere to be seen. Apparently
there was nothing left but to send
another apology. Rather than perform so
shameful and cowardly an act he would have
cut off his hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>The Barone, pale and determined, passed
the second note to Courtlandt who was congratulating
himself (prematurely as will be
seen) on the peaceful dispersion of the war-clouds.
He was dumfounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse me,&#8221; he said meekly. He
must see Abbott.</p>
<p>&#8220;A moment,&#8221; interposed the Barone coldly.
&#8220;If it is to seek another apology, it will be
useless. I refuse to accept. Mr. Abbott will
fight, or I will publicly brand him, the first
opportunity, as a coward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt bit his mustache. &#8220;In that case,
I shall go at once to Colonel Caxley-Webster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I shall be in my room at the
villa the greater part of the day.&#8221; The
Barone bowed.</p>
<p>Courtlandt caught the colonel as he was entering
his motor-boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over to tiffin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; I can talk here better than anywhere
else.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>When the motor began its racket, Courtlandt
pulled the colonel over to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what you have done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Done?&#8221; dropping his eye-glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Knowing that Abbott would have
no earthly chance against the Italian, I went
to him and forced him to write an apology.
And you have blown the whole thing higher
than a kite.&#8221;</p>
<p>The colonel&#8217;s eyes bulged. &#8220;Dem it, why
didn&#8217;t the young fool tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your hurry probably rattled him. But
what are we going to do? I&#8217;m not going to
have the boy hurt. I love him as a brother;
though, just now, he regards me as a mortal
enemy. Perhaps I am,&#8221; moodily. &#8220;I have
deceived him, and somehow&mdash;blindly it is true&mdash;he
knows it. I am as full of deceit as a
pomegranate is of seeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have him send another apology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Barone is thoroughly enraged. He
would refuse to accept it, and said so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dem me for a well-meaning meddler!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure, but that will not stop the
row. There is a way out, but it appeals to
me as damnably low.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Abbott will not run. He isn&#8217;t that
kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;ll not run. But if you will agree
with me, honor may be satisfied without either
of them getting hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women beat the devil, don&#8217;t they?
What&#8217;s your plan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt outlined it.</p>
<p>The colonel frowned. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound
like you. Beastly trick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll lunch first. It will take a few pegs
to get that idea through this bally head of
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Abbott came over later that day, he
was subdued in manner. He laughed occasionally,
smoked a few cigars, but declined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
stimulants. He even played a game of tennis
creditably. And after dinner he shot a hundred
billiards. The colonel watched his hands
keenly. There was not the slightest indication
of nerves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang the boy!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I ought
to be ashamed of myself. There isn&#8217;t a bit
of funk in his whole make-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>At nine Abbott retired. He did not sleep
very well. He was irked by the morbid idea
that the Barone was going to send the bullet
through his throat. He was up at five. He
strolled about the garden. He realized that
it was very good to be alive. Once he gazed
somberly at the little white villa, away to
the north. How crisply it stood out against
the dark foliage! How blue the water was!
And far, far away the serene snowcaps!
Nora Harrigan ... Well, he was going
to stand up like a man. She should
never be ashamed of her memory of him.
If he went out, all worry would be at an end,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
and that would be something. What a mess
he had made of things! He did not blame
the Italian. A duel! he, the son of a man
who had invented wash-tubs, was going to
fight a duel! He wanted to laugh; he wanted
to cry. Wasn&#8217;t he just dreaming? Wasn&#8217;t it
all a nightmare out of which he would presently
awake?</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast, Sahib,&#8221; said Rao, deferentially
touching his arm.</p>
<p>He was awake; it was all true.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll want coffee,&#8221; began the colonel.
&#8220;Drink as much as you like. And you&#8217;ll find
the eggs good, too.&#8221; The colonel wanted to
see if Abbott ate well.</p>
<p>The artist helped himself twice and drank
three cups of coffee. &#8220;You know, I suppose
all men in a hole like this have funny ideas.
I was just thinking that I should like a partridge
and a bottle of champagne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have that for tiffin,&#8221; said the colonel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
confidentially. In fact, he summoned
the butler and gave the order.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty kind of you, Colonel, to buck
me up this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot!&#8221; The colonel experienced a slight
heat in his leathery cheeks. &#8220;All you&#8217;ve got
to do is to hold your arm out straight, pull
the trigger, and squint afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t hurt the Barone,&#8221; smiling
faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to be ass enough to pop
your gun in the air?&#8221; indignantly.</p>
<p>Abbott shrugged; and the colonel cursed
himself for the guiltiest scoundrel unhung.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the opponents stood at
each end of the tennis-court. Ellicott, the
surgeon, had laid open his medical case. He
was the most agitated of the five men. His
fingers shook as he spread out the lints and
bandages. The colonel and Courtlandt had
solemnly gone through the formality of loading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
the weapons. The sun had not climbed
over the eastern summits, but the snow on the
western tops was rosy.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the word three, gentlemen, you will
fire,&#8221; said the colonel.</p>
<p>The two shots came simultaneously. Abbott
had deliberately pointed his into the air.
For a moment he stood perfectly still; then,
his knees sagged, and he toppled forward on
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great God!&#8221; whispered the colonel;
&#8220;you must have forgotten the ramrod!&#8221;</p>
<p>He, Courtlandt, and the surgeon rushed
over to the fallen man. The Barone stood
like stone. Suddenly, with a gesture of horror,
he flung aside his smoking pistol and ran
across the court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;on my honor, I
aimed three feet above his head.&#8221; He wrung
his hands together in anxiety. &#8220;It is impossible!
It is only that I wished to see if he
were a brave man. I shoot well. It is impossible!&#8221;
he reiterated.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-343.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 344px; height: 483px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 344px;'>
Suddenly he flung aside his smoking pistol.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></div>
<p>Rapidly the cunning hand of the surgeon
ran over Abbott&#8217;s body. He finally shook his
head. &#8220;Nothing has touched him. His heart
gave under. Fainted.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Abbott came to his senses, he smiled
weakly. The Barone was one of the two who
helped him to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like a fool,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, let me apologize now,&#8221; said the
Barone. &#8220;What I did at the ball was wrong,
and I should not have lost my temper. I had
come to you to apologize then. But I am
Italian. It is natural that I should lose my
temper,&#8221; naïvely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re both of us a pair of fools, Barone.
There was always some one else. A couple of
fools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted the Barone eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering,&#8221; whispered the colonel in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
Courtlandt&#8217;s ear; &#8220;considering that neither of
them knew they were shooting nothing more
dangerous than wads, they&#8217;re pretty good
specimens. Eh, what?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>COURTLANDT TELLS A STORY</h3>
</div>

<p>The Colonel and his guests at luncheon
had listened to Courtlandt without
sound or movement beyond the occasional rasp
of feet shifting under the table. He had begun
with the old familiar phrase&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve got
a story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell it,&#8221; had been the instant request.</p>
<p>At the beginning the men had been leaning
at various negligent angles,&mdash;some with their
elbows upon the table, some with their arms
thrown across the backs of their chairs. The
partridge had been excellent, the wine delicious,
the tobacco irreproachable. Burma,
the tinkle of bells in the temples, the strange
pictures in the bazaars, long journeys over
smooth and stormy seas; romance, moving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
and colorful, which began at Rangoon, had zigzagged
around the world, and ended in Berlin.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; concluded the teller of the tale,
&#8220;that is the story. This man was perfectly
innocent of any wrong, a victim of malice on
the one hand and of injustice on the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the end of the yarn?&#8221; asked the
colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who in life knows what the end of anything
is? This is not a story out of a book.&#8221;
Courtlandt accepted a fresh cigar from the
box which Rao passed to him, and dropped
his dead weed into the ash-bowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he given up?&#8221; asked Abbott, his
voice strangely unfamiliar in his own ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man can struggle just so long against
odds, then he wins or becomes broken.
Women are not logical; generally they permit
themselves to be guided by impulse rather than
by reason. This man I am telling you about
was proud; perhaps too proud. It is a shameful
fact, but he ran away. True, he wrote
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
letter after letter, but all these were returned
unopened. Then he stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman would a good deal rather
believe circumstantial evidence than not.
Humph!&#8221; The colonel primed his pipe and
relighted it. &#8220;She couldn&#8217;t have been worth
much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worth much!&#8221; cried Abbott. &#8220;What do
you imply by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No man will really give up a woman who
is really worth while, that is, of course, admitting
that your man, Courtlandt, <i>is</i> a man.
Perhaps, though, it was his fault. He was
not persistent enough, maybe a bit spineless.
The fact that he gave up so quickly possibly
convinced her that her impressions were correct.
Why, I&#8217;d have followed her day in and
day out, year after year; never would I have
let up until I had proved to her that she had
been wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The colonel is right,&#8221; Abbott approved,
never taking his eyes off Courtlandt, who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
apparently absorbed in the contemplation of
the bread crumbs under his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;And more, by hook or crook, I&#8217;d have
dragged in the other woman by the hair and
made her confess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not doubt it, Colonel,&#8221; responded
Courtlandt, with a dry laugh. &#8220;And that
would really have been the end of the story.
The heroine of this rambling tale would then
have been absolutely certain of collusion between
the two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is like a woman,&#8221; the Barone agreed,
and he knew something about them. &#8220;And
where is this man now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Courtlandt, pushing back his
chair and rising. &#8220;I am he.&#8221; He turned his
back upon them and sought the garden.</p>
<p>Tableau!</p>
<p>&#8220;Dash me!&#8221; cried the colonel, who, being
the least interested personally, was first to recover
his speech.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span></p>
<p>The Barone drew in his breath sharply.
Then he looked at Abbott.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspected it,&#8221; replied Abbott to the mute
question. Since the episode of that morning
his philosophical outlook had broadened. He
had fought a duel and had come out of it with
flying colors. As long as he lived he was certain
that the petty affairs of the day were never
again going to disturb him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him be,&#8221; was the colonel&#8217;s suggestion,
adding a gesture in the direction of the casement
door through which Courtlandt had gone.
&#8220;He&#8217;s as big a man as Nora is a woman. If
he has returned with the determination of winning
her, he will.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not see Courtlandt again. After
a few minutes of restless to-and-froing, he proceeded
down to the landing, helped himself to
the colonel&#8217;s motor-boat, and returned to Bellaggio.
At the hotel he asked for the duke,
only to be told that the duke and madame had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
left that morning for Paris. Courtlandt saw
that he had permitted one great opportunity
to slip past. He gave up the battle. One
more good look at her, and he would go away.
The odds had been too strong for him, and he
knew that he was broken.</p>
<p>When the motor-boat came back, Abbott and
the Barone made use of it also. They crossed
in silence, heavy-hearted.</p>
<p>On landing Abbott said: &#8220;It is probable
that I shall not see you again this year. I am
leaving to-morrow for Paris. It&#8217;s a great
world, isn&#8217;t it, where they toss us around like
dice? Some throw sixes and others deuces.
And in this game you and I have lost two out
of three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall return to Rome,&#8221; replied the
Barone. &#8220;My long leave of absence is near
its end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world can have happened?&#8221;
demanded Nora, showing the two notes to
Celeste. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Donald going to Paris to-morrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
and the Barone to Rome. They will
bid us good-by at tea. I don&#8217;t understand.
Donald was to remain until we left for America,
and the Barone&#8217;s leave does not end until
October.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow?&#8221; Dim-eyed, Celeste returned
the notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You play the fourth <i>ballade</i> and I&#8217;ll
sing from <i>Madame</i>. It will be very lonesome
without them.&#8221; Nora gazed into the
wall mirror and gave a pat or two to her hair.</p>
<p>When the men arrived, it was impressed
on Nora&#8217;s mind that never had she seen
them so amiable toward each other. They
were positively friendly. And why not? The
test of the morning had proved each of them
to his own individual satisfaction, and had
done away with those stilted mannerisms that
generally make rivals ridiculous in all eyes
save their own. The revelation at luncheon
had convinced them of the futility of things
in general and of woman in particular. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
were, without being aware of the fact, each
a consolation to the other. The old adage that
misery loves company was never more nicely
typified.</p>
<p>If Celeste expected Nora to exhibit any
signs of distress over the approaching departure,
she was disappointed. In truth, Nora
was secretly pleased to be rid of these two
suitors, much as she liked them. The Barone
had not yet proposed, and his sudden determination
to return to Rome eliminated this disagreeable
possibility. She was glad Abbott
was going because she had hurt him without
intention, and the sight of him was, in spite
of her innocence, a constant reproach. Presently
she would have her work, and there
would be no time for loneliness.</p>
<p>The person who suffered keenest was Celeste.
She was awake; the tender little dream was
gone; and bravely she accepted the fact.
Never her agile fingers stumbled, and she
played remarkably well, from Beethoven,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
Chopin, Grieg, Rubinstein, MacDowell. And
Nora, perversely enough, sang from old light
opera.</p>
<p>When the two men departed, Celeste went
to her room and Nora out upon the terrace.
It was after five. No one was about, so far
as she could see. She stood enchanted over
the transformation that was affecting the
mountains and the lakes. How she loved the
spot! How she would have liked to spend the
rest of her days here! And how beautiful all
the world was to-day!</p>
<p>She gave a frightened little scream. A
strong pair of arms had encircled her. She
started to cry out again, but the sound was
muffled and blotted out by the pressure of a
man&#8217;s lips upon her own. She struggled violently,
and suddenly was freed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were a man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you should
die for that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an opportunity not to be ignored,&#8221;
returned Courtlandt. &#8220;It is true that I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
a fool to run away as I did, but my return has
convinced me that I should have been as much
a fool had I remained to tag you about, begging
for an interview. I wrote you letters.
You returned them unopened. You have condemned
me without a hearing. So be it. You
may consider that kiss the farewell appearance
so dear to the operatic heart,&#8221; bitterly.</p>
<p>He addressed most of this to the back of
her head, for she was already walking toward
the villa into which she disappeared with the
proud air of some queen of tragedy. She was
a capital actress.</p>
<p>A heavy hand fell upon Courtlandt&#8217;s shoulder.
He was irresistibly drawn right about
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, Mr. Courtlandt,&#8221; said Harrigan,
his eyes blue and cold as ice, &#8220;perhaps
you will explain?&#8221;</p>
<p>With rage and despair in his heart, Courtlandt
flung off the hand and answered: &#8220;I
refuse!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Harrigan stood off a few steps and
ran his glance critically up and down this man
of whom he had thought to make a friend.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a husky lad. There&#8217;s one way out of
this for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as it does not necessitate any explanations,&#8221;
indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the bottom of one of Nora&#8217;s trunks is
a set of my old gloves. There will not be any
one up at the tennis-court this time of day.
If you are not a mean cuss, if you are not an
ordinary low-down imitation of a man, you&#8217;ll
meet me up there inside of five minutes. If
you can stand up in front of me for ten minutes,
you need not make any explanations. On
the other hand, you&#8217;ll hike out of here as fast
as boats and trains can take you. And never
come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am nearly twenty years younger than
you, Mr. Harrigan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let that worry you any,&#8221; with a
truculent laugh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. You will find me there.
After all, you are her father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrigan stole into his daughter&#8217;s room and
soundlessly bored into the bottom of the trunk
that contained the relics of past glory. As
he pulled them forth, a folded oblong strip of
parchment came out with them and fluttered
to the floor; but he was too busily engaged to
notice it, nor would he have bothered if he
had. The bottom of the trunk was littered
with old letters and programs and operatic
scores. He wrapped the gloves in a newspaper
and got away without being seen. He was as
happy as a boy who had discovered an opening
in the fence between him and the apple orchard.
He was rather astonished to see Courtlandt
kneeling in the clover-patch, hunting for a
four-leaf clover. It was patent that the young
man was not troubled with nerves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; he cried, bruskly, tossing over
a pair of gloves. &#8220;If this method of settling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
the dispute isn&#8217;t satisfactory, I&#8217;ll accept your
explanations.&#8221;</p>
<p>For reply Courtlandt stood up and stripped
to his undershirt. He drew on the gloves and
laced them with the aid of his teeth. Then
he kneaded them carefully. The two men
eyed each other a little more respectfully than
they had ever done before.</p>
<p>&#8220;This single court is about as near as we
can make it. The man who steps outside is
whipped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree,&#8221; said Courtlandt.</p>
<p>&#8220;No rounds with rests; until one or the
other is outside. Clean breaks. That&#8217;s about
all. Now, put up your dukes and take a man&#8217;s
licking. I thought you were your father&#8217;s son,
but I guess you are like the rest of &#8217;em, hunters
of women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt laughed and stepped to the middle
of the court. Harrigan did not waste any
time. He sent in a straight jab to the jaw,
but Courtlandt blocked it neatly and countered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
with a hard one on Harrigan&#8217;s ear, which began
to swell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; growled Harrigan. &#8220;You know
something about the game. It won&#8217;t be as if
I was walloping a baby.&#8221; He sent a left to
the body, but the right failed to reach his
man.</p>
<p>For some time Harrigan jabbed and swung
and upper-cut; often he reached his opponent&#8217;s
body, but never his face. It worried him a
little to find that he could not stir Courtlandt
more than two or three feet. Courtlandt
never followed up any advantage, thus making
Harrigan force the fighting, which was rather
to his liking. But presently it began to enter
his mind convincingly that apart from the
initial blow, the younger man was working
wholly on the defensive. As if he were afraid
he might hurt him! This served to make the
old fellow furious. He bored in right and
left, left and right, and Courtlandt gave way,
step by step until he was so close to the line
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
that he could see it from the corner of his
eye. This glance, swift as it was, came near
to being his undoing. Harrigan caught him
with a terrible right on the jaw. It was a
glancing blow, otherwise the fight would have
ended then and there. Instantly he lurched
forward and clenched before the other could
add the finishing touch.</p>
<p>The two pushed about, Harrigan fiercely
striving to break the younger man&#8217;s hold. He
was beginning to breathe hard besides. A little
longer, and his blows would lack the proper
steam. Finally Courtlandt broke away of his
own accord. His head buzzed a little, but
aside from that he had recovered. Harrigan
pursued his tactics and rushed. But this time
there was an offensive return. Courtlandt became
the aggressor. There was no withstanding
him. And Harrigan fairly saw the end;
but with that indomitable pluck which had
made him famous in the annals of the ring, he
kept banging away. The swift cruel jabs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
here and there upon his body began to tell.
Oh, for a minute&#8217;s rest and a piece of lemon
on his parched tongue! Suddenly Courtlandt
rushed him tigerishly, landing a jab which
closed Harrigan&#8217;s right eye. Courtlandt
dropped his hands, and stepped back. His
glance traveled suggestively to Harrigan&#8217;s feet.
He was outside the &#8220;ropes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Mr. Harrigan, for losing
my temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the odds? I lost mine. You
win.&#8221; Harrigan was a true sportsman. He
had no excuses to offer. He had dug the pit
of humiliation with his own hands. He recognized
this as one of two facts. The other was,
that had Courtlandt extended himself, the battle
would have lasted about one minute. It
was gall and wormwood, but there you were.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, you ask for explanations.
Ask your daughter to make them.&#8221; Courtlandt
pulled off the gloves and got into his
clothes. &#8220;You may add, sir, that I shall never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
trouble her again with my unwelcome attentions.
I leave for Milan in the morning.&#8221;
Courtlandt left the field of victory without
further comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of that?&#8221; mused
Harrigan, as he stooped over to gather up the
gloves. &#8220;Any one would say that he was the
injured party. I&#8217;m in wrong on this deal
somewhere. I&#8217;ll ask Miss Nora a question or
two.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not so easy returning. He ran into
his wife. He tried to dodge her, but without
success.</p>
<p>&#8220;James, where did you get that black eye?&#8221;
tragically.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a daisy, ain&#8217;t it, Molly?&#8221; pushing past
her into Nora&#8217;s room and closing the door
after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Nora?&#8221; blinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, if you have been fighting with <i>him</i>,
I&#8217;ll never forgive you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it, Nora. I wasn&#8217;t fighting. I
only thought I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised the lid of the trunk and cast in
the gloves haphazard. And then he saw the
paper which had fallen out. He picked it up
and squinted at it, for he could not see very
well. Nora was leaving the room in a temper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going, Nora?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am. And I advise you to have your
dinner in your room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alone, he turned on the light. It never occurred
to him that he might be prying into
some of Nora&#8217;s private correspondence. He
unfolded the parchment and held it under the
light. For a long time he stared at the writing,
which was in English, at the date, at the
names. Then he quietly refolded it and put
it away for future use, immediate future use.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a great world,&#8221; he murmured, rubbing
his ear tenderly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>JOURNEY&#8217;S END</h3>
</div>

<p>Harrigan dined alone. He was in disgrace;
he was sore, mentally as well as
physically; and he ate his dinner without relish,
in simple obedience to those well regulated
periods of hunger that assailed him three
times a day, in spring, summer, autumn and
winter. By the time the waiter had cleared
away the dishes, Harrigan had a perfecto between
his teeth (along with a certain matrimonial
bit), and smoked as if he had wagered
to finish the cigar in half the usual stretch.
He then began to walk the floor, much after
the fashion of a man who has the toothache,
or the earache, which would be more to the
point. To his direct mind no diplomacy was
needed; all that was necessary was a few blunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
questions. Nora could answer them as she
chose. Nora, his baby, his little girl that used
to run around barefooted and laugh when he
applied the needed birch! How children grew
up! And they never grew too old for the
birch; they certainly never did.</p>
<p>They heard him from the drawing-room;
tramp, tramp, tramp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him be, Nora,&#8221; said Mrs. Harrigan,
wisely. &#8220;He is in a rage about something.
And your father is not the easiest man to approach
when he&#8217;s mad. If he fought Mr.
Courtlandt, he believed he had some good reason
for doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, there are times when I believe you
are afraid of father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am always afraid of him. It is only
because I make believe I&#8217;m not that I can get
him to do anything. It was dreadful. And
Mr. Courtlandt was such a gentleman. I could
cry. But let your father be until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have him wandering about with that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
black eye? Something must be done for it.
I&#8217;m not afraid of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I wish you were.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Nora entered the lion&#8217;s den fearlessly.
&#8220;Is there anything I can do for you, dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get the witch-hazel and bathe this
lamp of mine,&#8221; grimly.</p>
<p>She ran into her own room and returned
with the simpler devices for reducing a swollen
eye. She did not notice, or pretended that she
didn&#8217;t, that he locked the door and put the key
in his pocket. He sat down in a chair, under
the light; and she went to work deftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some make-up, and to-morrow
morning I&#8217;ll paint it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t ask any questions,&#8221; he said, with
grimness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it relieve your eye any?&#8221; lightly.</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;No; but it might relieve my
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, why did you do so foolish a
thing? At your age! Don&#8217;t you know that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
you can&#8217;t go on whipping every man you take a
dislike to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t taken any dislike to Courtlandt.
But I saw him kiss you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can take care of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. I asked him to explain. He refused.
One thing puzzled me, though I didn&#8217;t
know what it was at the time. Now, when a
fellow steals a kiss from a beautiful woman
like you, Nora, I don&#8217;t see why he should feel
mad about it. When he had all but knocked
your daddy to by-by, he said that you could
explain.... Don&#8217;t press so hard,&#8221; warningly.
&#8220;Well, can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you saw what he did, I do not see
where explanations on my part are necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora, I&#8217;ve never caught you in a lie. I
never want to. When you were little you were
the truthfullest thing I ever saw. No matter
what kind of a licking was in store for you,
you weren&#8217;t afraid; you told the truth....
There, that&#8217;ll do. Put some cotton over it and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
bind it with a handkerchief. It&#8217;ll be black all
right, but the swelling will go down. I can
tell &#8217;em a tennis-ball hit me. It was more like
a cannon-ball, though. Say, Nora, you know
I&#8217;ve always pooh-poohed these amateurs. People
used to say that there were dozens of men
in New York in my prime who could have
laid me cold. I used to laugh. Well, I guess
they were right. Courtlandt&#8217;s got the stiffest
kick I ever ran into. A pile-driver, and if he
had landed on my jaw, it would have been
<i>dormi bene</i>, as you say when you bid me good
night in dago. That&#8217;s all right now until to-morrow.
I want to talk to you. Draw up a
chair. There! As I said, I&#8217;ve never caught
you in a lie, but I find that you&#8217;ve been living
a lie for two years. You haven&#8217;t been square
to me, nor to your mother, nor to the chaps
that came around and made love to you. You
probably didn&#8217;t look at it that way, but there&#8217;s
the fact. I&#8217;m not Paul Pry; but accidentally
I came across this,&#8221; taking the document from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
his pocket and handing it to her. &#8220;Read it.
What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora&#8217;s hands trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Takes you a long time to read it. Is it
true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I went up to the tennis-court with the
intention of knocking his head off; and now
I&#8217;m wondering why he didn&#8217;t knock off mine.
Nora, he&#8217;s a man; and when you get through
with this, I&#8217;m going down to the hotel and
apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will do nothing of the sort; not with
that eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I was always worried for fear
you&#8217;d hook up with some duke you&#8217;d have to
support. Now, I want to know how this chap
happens to be my son-in-law. Make it brief,
for I don&#8217;t want to get tangled up more than
is necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora crackled the certificate in her fingers
and stared unseeingly at it for some time. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
met him first in Rangoon,&#8221; she began slowly,
without raising her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you went around the world on your
own?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Oh, don&#8217;t worry. I was always
able to take care of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An Irish idea,&#8221; answered Harrigan complacently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved him, father, with all my heart and
soul. He was not only big and strong and
handsome, but he was kindly and tender and
thoughtful. Why, I never knew that he was
rich until after I had promised to be his wife.
When I learned that he was the Edward Courtlandt
who was always getting into the newspapers,
I laughed. There were stories about
his escapades. There were innuendoes regarding
certain women, but I put them out of my
mind as twaddle. Ah, never had I been so
happy! In Berlin we went about like two children.
It was play. He brought me to the
Opera and took me away; and we had the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
charming little suppers. I never wrote you or
mother because I wished to surprise you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have. Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never paid much attention to Flora
Desimone, though I knew that she was jealous
of my success. Several times I caught her
looking at Edward in a way I did not like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She looked at him, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the last performance of the season.
We were married that afternoon. We did not
want any one to know about it. I was not to
leave the stage until the end of the following
season. We were staying at the same hotel,
with rooms across the corridor. This was
much against his wishes, but I prevailed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our rooms were opposite, as I said. After
the performance that night I went to mine to
complete the final packing. We were to leave
at one for the Tyrol. Father, I saw Flora
Desimone come out of his room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrigan shut and opened his hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you understand? I saw her. She
was laughing. I did not see him. My wedding
night! She came from his room. My
heart stopped, the world stopped, everything
went black. All the stories that I had read
and heard came back. When he knocked at
my door I refused to see him. I never saw
him again until that night in Paris when he
forced his way into my apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it, Nora, this doesn&#8217;t sound like
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wrote you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I returned the letters, unopened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t square. You might have been
wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wrote five letters. After that he went
to India, to Africa and back to India, where he
seemed to find consolation enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrigan laid it to his lack of normal vision,
but to his single optic there was anything but
misery in her beautiful blue eyes. True, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
sparkled with tears; but that signified nothing:
he hadn&#8217;t been married these thirty-odd years
without learning that a woman weeps for any
of a thousand and one reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you care for him still?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a day passed during these many
months that I did not vow I hated him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any one else know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The padre. I had to tell some one or go
mad. But I didn&#8217;t hate him. I could no more
put him out of my life than I could stop
breathing. Ah, I have been so miserable and
unhappy!&#8221; She laid her head upon his knees
and clumsily he stroked it. His girl!</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble with us Irish, Nora.
We jump without looking, without finding
whether we&#8217;re right or wrong. Well, your
daddy&#8217;s opinion is that you should have read
his first letter. If it didn&#8217;t ring right, why,
you could have jumped the traces. I don&#8217;t
believe he did anything wrong at all. It isn&#8217;t
in the man&#8217;s blood to do anything underboard.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I <i>saw</i> her,&#8221; a queer look in her eyes as
she glanced up at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a kioodle if you did. Take
it from me, it was a put-up job by that Calabrian
woman. She might have gone to his
room for any number of harmless things.
But I think she was curious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t she come to me, if she wanted
to ask questions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see you answering &#8217;em. She probably
just wanted to know if you were married
or not. She might have been in love with him,
and then she might not. These Italians don&#8217;t
know half the time what they&#8217;re about, anyhow.
But I don&#8217;t believe it of Courtlandt.
He doesn&#8217;t line up that way. Besides, he&#8217;s
got eyes. You&#8217;re a thousand times more attractive.
He&#8217;s no fool. Know what I think?
As she was coming out she saw <i>you</i> at your
door; and the devil in her got busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nora rose, flung her arms around him and
kissed him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for that tin ear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you great big, loyal, true-hearted man!
Open that door and let me get out to the terrace.
I want to sing, sing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he was going to Milan in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>She danced to the door and was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora!&#8221; he called, impatiently. He listened
in vain for the sound of her return.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll take the count when it comes to
guessing what a woman&#8217;s going to do. I&#8217;ll
go out and square up with the old girl. Wonder
how this news will harness up with her
social bug?&#8221;</p>
<p>Courtlandt got into his compartment at
Varenna. He had tipped the guard liberally
not to open the door for any one else, unless
the train was crowded. As the shrill blast of
the conductor&#8217;s horn sounded the warning of
&#8220;all aboard,&#8221; the door opened and a heavily
veiled woman got in hurriedly. The train began
to move instantly. The guard slammed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
the door and latched it. Courtlandt sighed:
the futility of trusting these Italians, of trying
to buy their loyalty! The woman was without
any luggage whatever, not even the usual
magazine. She was dressed in brown, her hat
was brown, her veil, her gloves, her shoes.
But whether she was young or old was beyond
his deduction. He opened his <i>Corriere</i> and
held it before his eyes; but he found reading
impossible. The newspaper finally slipped
from his hands to the floor where it swayed
and rustled unnoticed. He was staring at the
promontory across Lecco, the green and restful
hill, the little earthly paradise out of which he
had been unjustly cast. He couldn&#8217;t understand.
He had lived cleanly and decently; he
had wronged no man or woman, nor himself.
And yet, through some evil twist of fate, he
had lost all there was in life worth having.
The train lurched around a shoulder of the
mountain. He leaned against the window.
In a moment more the villa was gone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span></p>
<p>What was it? He felt irresistibly drawn.
Without intending to do so, he turned and
stared at the woman in brown. Her hand
went to the veil and swept it aside. Nora was
as full of romance as a child. She could have
stopped him before he made the boat, but she
wanted to be alone with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora!&#8221;</p>
<p>She flung herself on her knees in front of
him. &#8220;I am a wretch!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He could only repeat her name.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not worth my salt. Ah, why did
you run away? Why did you not pursue me,
importune me until I wearied? ... perhaps
gladly? There were times when I would
have opened my arms had you been the worst
scoundrel in the world instead of the dearest
lover, the patientest! Ah, can you forgive
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive you, Nora?&#8221; He was numb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a miserable wretch! I doubted you,
I! When all I had to do was to recall the way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
people misrepresented things I had done! I
sent back your letters ... and read and
reread the old blue ones. Don&#8217;t you remember
how you used to write them on blue paper? ... Flora
told me everything. It was
only because she hated me, not that she cared
anything about you. She told me that night
at the ball. I believe the duke forced her to
do it. She was at the bottom of the abduction.
When you kissed me ... didn&#8217;t
you know that I kissed you back? Edward, I
am a miserable wretch, but I shall follow you
wherever you go, and I haven&#8217;t even a vanity-box
in my hand-bag!&#8221; There were tears in
her eyes. &#8220;Say that I am a wretch!&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew her up beside him. His arms
closed around her so hungrily, so strongly,
that she gasped a little. He looked into her
eyes; his glance traveled here and there over
her face, searching for the familiar dimple at
one corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nora!&#8221; he whispered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss me!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then the train came to a stand, jerkily.
They fell back against the cushions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lecco!&#8221; cried the guard through the window.</p>
<p>They laughed like children.</p>
<p>&#8220;I bribed him,&#8221; she said gaily. &#8220;And
now....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and now?&#8221; eagerly, if still bewilderedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back!&#8221;</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>THE END</p>
